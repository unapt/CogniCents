CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 1.ORGANIZATION AND PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES General Enterprise Ventures, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated as Ultronics Corporation (the “UC”) under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 14, 1990. UC never had operations and was formed to investigate potential companies that would be interested in merging with it. On December 21, 2004, UC formed a subsidiary, Ultronics Acquisition Corporation (“UAC”) for the purpose of facilitating an agreement and plan of merger. UAC was incorporated in the State of Nevada. On December 23, 2004, UC, UAC and General Environmental Management, Inc. (“GEM”) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger whereby UAC would be merged into GEM (“Merger”) with GEM to be the surviving corporation. On February 14, 2005, a Certificate of Merger was filed in Delaware; however, there is no evidence of a Certificate of Merger being filed in Nevada. As such, GEM did not cease to exist in Nevada. The acquisition was treated as a reverse merger with GEM deemed to be the accounting acquiror, and UAC the legal acquiror. UAC’s name was changed to General Environmental Management, Inc. (the “Company”) on March 16, 2005. On March 10, 2006, the Company entered into an Agreement with K2M Mobile Treatment Services, Inc. of Long Beach, California (“K2M”), a privately held company, pursuant to which the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding common stock of K2M. On August 31, 2008, The Company entered into an agreement with Island Environmental Services, Inc. of Pomona, California (“Island”), a privately held company, pursuant to which The Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Island, a California-based provider of hazardous and non-hazardous waste removal and remediation services to a variety of private and public sector establishments. On November 6, 2009, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (“CLW Agreement”) with United States Environmental Response, LLC, a California limited liability company pursuant to which the Company purchased all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of California Living Waters, Incorporated (“CLW”), a privately held company.  CLW owns all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Santa Clara Waste Water Company (“SCWW”) a California corporation. CLW's only operating subsidiary is SCWW. On November 25, 2009, the Company entered into an Agreement with Luntz Acquisition (Delaware), LLC. (“Buyer”) pursuant to which the Company sold to Luntz all of the issued and outstanding stock of the Company's primary operating subsidiaries for cash (the “Sale”). On February 26, 2010, after approval of the transaction by the Company’s shareholders at a special meeting held on February 19, 2010, the Company completed the sale of the entities created out of GEM DE. The net cash proceeds from the transaction were used by the Company to retire senior debt and other obligations of the Company. The Company was not merged out of Nevada pursuant to this transaction. Subsequent to the Luntz transaction, the Company’s revenues and expenses, operations, assets and liabilities were discontinued from February 2010 until January 2021. On March 19, 2019, Small Cap Compliance, LLC was awarded custodianship of the Company by the Eighth Judicial District Court of Nevada. On May 19, 2019, the Company was revived in Nevada. On May 30, 2019, the custodian filed an Amendment to the Designations of the Series A Convertible Preferred Shares of the Company, and filed a Custodian’s Certification of Amendment certifying the same.     7   On January 15, 2021, the Company filed a Certificate of Conversion from a Non-Delaware Corporation to a Delaware Corporation, and the associated Certificate of Incorporation, to become a corporation in Delaware. Delaware recognized this domestication of the Company. On March 31, 2021, the Company formed General Entertainment Ventures, Inc. (“GEVI”) in Delaware as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The purpose of the formation of GEVI was to merge the Company into GEVI pursuant to Section 251(g) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. On April 10, 2021, after approval by the board of directors and shareholders of the Company, the Company was merged into GEVI pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of the same date. GEVI is the accounting and legal acquiror of the Company. On June 3, 2021, after approval by the board of directors and shareholders of the Company, the Company was redomiciled to the State of Wyoming. On October 11, 2021, after approval by the board of directors and shareholders of the Company, the Company was renamed General Enterprise Ventures, Inc., in the State of Wyoming. The Company’s year-end is December 31st BASIS OF PRESENTATION The consolidated interim financial statements included herein have been prepared by the Company, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, in the opinion of management, include all adjustments which, except, as described elsewhere herein, are of a normal recurring nature, necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the period presented. Because the Company was dormant from the period from February 2010 through January 2021, the Company used the following methodology to prepare its financial statements. All assets on the Company’s March 31, 2010 balance were deemed disposed of for no value and fully impaired for quarter beginning April 1, 2010. All Company activities at that became discontinued operations with the exception of accrued interest recorded on outstanding debt. All liabilities outstanding as of March 31, 2010 remained on the Company’s balance sheet accruing interest until the quarter ending March 31, 2017 when they were written off due to the expiration of the Statue of Limitations. GOING CONCERN The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company utilized cash in operations of $-0- for the six months ended June 30, 2014 and as of June 30, 2014 the Company had a working capital deficiency of $30,709,368 and had a stockholders’ deficit of $99,114,750. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company will also research technological opportunities in the waste-to-energy (W-T-E) marketplace as a further resource for our non-hazardous waste water treatment facilities.  A W-T-E solution for managing the treating waste provides a significant advantage for generators of the waste, the environment, and the Company. The Company will continue to develop SCWW as the foundation of our core business in the non-hazardous waste water treatment sector.  We intend to do this through internal growth by offering SCWW’s integrated solution for generators of non-hazardous waste water and by making strategic acquisitions of non-hazardous waste water treatment companies.     8   2.SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (a)  Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of General Enterprise Ventures Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, General Environmental Management, Inc., a Delaware corporation, Island Environmental Services, Inc., a California corporation,  General Environmental Management of Rancho Cordova, LLC and California Living Waters Inc. Inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated. (b)  Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the Company’s management to make certain estimates and assumptions.  These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of the contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements.  These estimates and assumptions will also affect the reported amounts of certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ materially based on any changes in the estimates and assumptions that the Company uses in the preparation of its financial statements that are reviewed no less than annually.  Actual results could differ materially from these estimates and assumptions due to changes in environmental-related regulations or future operational plans, and the inherent imprecision associated with estimating such future matters. (c) Revenue Recognition The Company's business activities include providing wastewater treatment for companies and haulers in Ventura County, California, and in adjacent counties. The Company recognizes revenue at the time its customers unload untreated wastewater at the Company's facility. Concurrent with the recognition of revenue, the Company records the estimated costs to treat and dispose of the wastewater on hand. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. (d) Concentrations of Credit Risks The Company’s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and trade receivables.  The Company places its cash in what it believes to be credit-worthy financial institutions.  However, cash balances have exceeded FDIC insured levels at various times.  The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant risk in cash. The Company’s trade receivables result primarily from removal or transportation of waste, and the concentration of credit risk is limited to a broad customer base located throughout the Western United States. (e) Fair Value of Financial Instruments Fair Value Measurements are adopted by the Company based on the authoritative guidance provided by the Financial Accounting Standards Board , with the exception of the application of the statement to non-recurring, non-financial assets and liabilities as permitted. The adoption based on the authoritative guidance provided by the Financial Accounting Standards Board did not have a material impact on the Company's fair value measurements. Based on the authoritative guidance provided by the Financial Accounting Standards Board defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. FASB authoritative guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value into three broad levels as follows: Level 1- Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level 2- Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly.Level 3- Unobservable inputs based on the Company's assumptions.    9   FASB issued authoritative guidance that requires the use of observable market data if such data is available without undue cost and effort. (f) Stock Compensation Costs The Company periodically issues stock options and warrants to employees and non-employees in capital raising transactions, for services and for financing costs.  Stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period.  Options vest and expire according to terms established at the grant date. (g) Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The diluted earnings per share calculation give effect to all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method for warrants and options and the if-converted method for convertible debentures. (h) Recent Accounting Pronouncements In October 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on revenue recognition that will become effective for the Company beginning July 1, 2010, with earlier adoption permitted. Under the new guidance on arrangements that include software elements, tangible products that have software components that are essential to the functionality of the tangible product will no longer be within the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance, and software-enabled products will now be subject to other relevant revenue recognition guidance. We believe adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements. In January 2010, the FASB issued guidance on improving disclosures about fair value measurements to add new disclosure requirements for significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and 2 measurements and to provide a gross presentation of the activities within the Level 3 roll-forward. The guidance also clarifies existing fair value disclosures about the level of disaggregation and about inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The disclosure requirements are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the requirement to present the Level 3 roll-forward on a gross basis, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010. The adoption of this guidance was limited to the form and content of disclosures, and will not have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition. Other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB (including its Emerging Issues Task Force), the AICPA, and the SEC did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company's present or future consolidated financial statements . 3.RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Advances from Related Parties During 2008, General Pacific Partners  (“GPP”), a company operated by a prior member of the Board of Directors of the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, General Environmental Management, Inc. of Delaware, made two unsecured advances to the Company totaling $472,500. The rate of interest on the advances was 10% per annum. As of December 31, 2009, $534,129 was outstanding under this advance (including accrued interest of $61,719). In 2008, GPP also provided certain financing services for which the Company agreed to pay GPP $250,000. The balance due to GPP for these services was $100,000 as of December 31, 2009. During the three month period ended March 31, 2010, General Pacific Partners agreed to convert $575,000 of the indebtedness to GPP into 1,437,500 shares of the Company’s common stock. The shares issued to GPP were valued at $273,125 based upon the trading price of the shares at the date of the agreement, resulting in a gain to the Company of $301,875. As of March 31, 2010, the remaining balance due to GPP was $69,226.    10   During the year ended December 31, 2009 a related individual made an unsecured advance with no formal terms of repayment to the Company totaling $115,000. The proceeds were used for working capital purposes. At June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 the balance due on the advance was $97,500  and $97,500 respectively. Due to Officers and Directors Commensurate with the closing of the sale to Luntz (see Note 4), certain officers and directors were granted a bonus $765,000 which is outstanding as of June 30, 2014. 4.SECURED FINANCING AGREEMENTS During the period 2008 through 2009, the Company entered into a series of financings with CVC California, LLC (“CVC”). The amounts due under these financings at June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 are as follows:   June 30,  December 31,   2014  2013   (Unaudited)           Secured Notes from CVC California $6,777,027  $6,777,027 Valuation Discount  –   –   $6,777,027  $6,777,027  Note Agreements with CVC California On September 4, 2009, the Company entered into a series of agreements with CVC that amended these agreements, including an Amended and Restated Revolving Credit and Term Loan Agreement, an Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Note, an Amended and Restated Convertible Term Note, a new Term Note, and Amended and Restated Warrants to purchase shares of the Company's common stock.

This is an unsecured note that is subordinated to the National Bank of California notes and all debts allowed in the Company's bankruptcy reorganization.     16   7.DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES In 2009, the Company adopted the FASB’s guidance on “Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) is indexed to an Entity’s Own Stock.” This guidance requires that instruments which do not have fixed settlement provisions are deemed to be derivative instruments.  The conversion feature of the Company’s Secured Financing and the related warrants, do not have fixed settlement provisions because their conversion and exercise prices, respectively, may be lowered if the Company issues securities at lower prices in the future.  The Company was required to include the reset provisions in order to protect the note holders from the potential dilution associated with future financings. In accordance with current guidance, the conversion feature of the notes was separated from the host contract (i.e., the notes) and recognized as an embedded derivative instrument at December 31, 2009. During the three months ended March 31, 2010, the Company eliminated these derivative liabilities. Warrant Liability In connection with the CVC financings described in Note 7, the Company had granted to CVC an Amended and Restated Warrant  to purchase Two Million Seven Hundred Thousand (2,700,000) fully paid and non-assessable shares (the “Warrant Shares”) of the Company’s common stock, for cash at a price of $0.01 per share at any time and from time to time from and after the date hereof and until 5:00 p.m. (Pacific time) on August 31, 2014.   CVC  also  had  the right and option, exercisable effective at any time upon or after the consummation of a Sale of the Company’s revenue-generating business units, or upon and after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default or any other event or circumstance which causes, effects or requires any payment in full under the Loan Agreement and until the Expiration Date, to require the Company to redeem and purchase any or all Warrant Shares or rights to purchase Warrant Shares hereunder, for a cash purchase price of $0.75 per Warrant Share or per right to purchase a Warrant Share hereunder, such option purchase price to be subject to adjustment from time to time in respect of certain events.  The total value of the put if all shares are redeemed was $2,025,000, and was recorded as a derivative liability at December 31, 2009.  In conjunction with the closing and the Amended and Restated Warrant to Purchase Shares of Common Stock, CVC of California exercised its put option related to its warrant for 2,700,000 shares for a cash purchase price of $0.75 per Warrant Share or $2,000,000.  At closing, CVC was paid $500,000 and issued 3,750,000 shares of the Company’s common stock valued at $712,500 to satisfy the put option, resulting in a gain on extinguishment of the derivative liability of $812,500 in the accompanying March 31, 2010 statement of operations.          17   Conversion feature The principal amount of the Convertible Note and accrued interest thereon due CVC was convertible into shares of the Company's common stock at a price of $0.60 per share, subject to certain adjustments.  The convertible feature gave rise to a derivative liability that was valued at $896,542 at December 31, 2009. Concurrent with the extinguishment of the convertible note during 2010, the derivative liability was extinguished and a gain of $896,542 was recorded in the accompanying March 31, 2010 statement of operations. 8.STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS On March 28, 2007 the Board of Directors approved and implemented the 2007 Stock Option Plan (the “Plan”).  The plan authorized option grants to employees and other persons closely associated with the Company for the purchase of up to 5,500,000 shares. No options were issued during the quarter ended June 30, 2014.   Weighted Avg.  Weighted Avg.  Weighted Avg.   Options  Exercise Price  Life in Years           Options outstanding, January 1, 2010  3,400,155   1.54   7.58 Options granted  –   –   – Options exercised  –   –   – Options cancelled  (192,083)  1.60   – Options outstanding, March 31, 2010  3,208,072   1.53   7.30 Options exercisable, March 31, 2010  2,985,563   1.58   7.20  The options had no intrinsic value at June 30, 2014. For the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009, the fair value of options vesting during the period was $119,677 and $261,734 respectively, and has been reflected as compensation cost. As of June 30, 2014, the Company has unvested options valued at $151,287 which will be reflected as compensation cost over the estimated remaining vesting period of 24 months.    18   Warrants A summary of the warrant activity during the period is as follows:   Shares outstanding  Range of exercise prices  Weighted Avg. in Years Warrants outstanding, January 1, 2010  10,411,426  $0.52-$37.50   4.19 Warrants granted  –   –   – Warrants exercised  –   –   – Warrants expired  –   –   – Warrants outstanding, March 31, 2010  10,411,426  $0.52-$37.50   3.92  The warrants had no intrinsic value at June 30, 2014. 9.COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Legal Proceeding On July 5, 2007, a lawsuit was instituted by Romic Environmental Technologies Corp. (“RET”) against the Company and four of its senior executives, all of whom were formerly employed by RET.  The lawsuit was brought in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles.  The lawsuit was settled by the Company in February 2010 with the majority of the settlement payment funded by insurance. The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of its business.  Although occasional adverse decisions or settlements may occur, the Company believes that the final disposition of such matters will not have material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 10.INCOME TAXES The Company's net deferred tax assets consisted of the following at June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013:   June 30,2014  December 31,2013    (Unaudited)              Deferred tax asset, net operating loss $–  $– Less valuation allowance  –   – Net deferred tax asset $–  $–        19   As of March 31, 2010, the Company had federal net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $27,245,415 expiring in various years through 2025, which can be used to offset future taxable income, if any. No deferred asset benefit for these operating losses has been recognized in the financial statements due  to the uncertainty as to their realizability in future periods. As of March 31, 2010, the Company recorded a gain on the sale of General Environmental Management,  Inc. (DE) and its subsidiaries (“GEM Delaware”), which include five service centers, the TSDF of GEM Rancho Cordova LLC, and the Island Environmental Services business (See Note 4).  Due to the State of California disallowing the use of NOL carryforwards for the calendar year 2010, the Company recorded a state tax provision of $325,000.  Due to the affect of the Federal Alternative Minimum Tax on the gain transaction, the Company recorded a $100,000 federal tax provision. Reconciliation of the effective income tax rate to the United States statutory income tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2014 is as follows:   June 30,   2014     Tax expense at U.S. statutory income tax rate  (34.0%)Increase in the valuation allowance  34.0 Effective rate  –   Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted  a new accounting requirement to Account for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. The interpretation addresses the determination  of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under the new accounting requirements, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The new requirements  also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures. At the date of adoption, and as of  March 31, 2010, the Company did not have a liability for unrecognized tax uncertainties. The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various states. The Company is subject to U.S. federal or state income tax examinations by tax authorities for years after 2002. During the periods open to examination, the Company has net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards for U.S. federal and state tax purposes that have attributes from closed periods. Because these NOLs and tax credit carry forwards may be utilized in future periods, they remain subject to examination. The Company’s policy is to record interest and penalties on uncertain tax provisions as income tax expense. As of March 31, 2010 the Company has no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions.    20   ITEM 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS In addition to historical information, this Quarterly Report contains forward-looking statements, which are generally identifiable by use of  the words “believes”, “expects”, “intends”, “anticipates”, “plans to”, “estimates”, “ projects”, or similar expressions.  These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in these forward-looking statements.  Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Factors That May Affect Future Results”.  Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect management’s opinions only as of the date hereof.  We undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to these forward-looking statements.  Readers should carefully review the risk factors described in other documents the company files from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission  ( the “SEC”), Statements made in this Form 10-Q (the “Quarterly Report”) that are not historical or current facts are “forward-looking statements” made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).  We intend that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors for such statements.  We wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made.  Any forward-looking statements represent management’s best judgment as to what may occur in the future.  The forward-looking statements included herein are based on current expectations that involve numerous risks and uncertainties.  Assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive and market conditions and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond our control.  Although we believe that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate and, therefore, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report will prove to be accurate.  In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that our objectives and plans will be achieved.  We disclaim any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statement or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.  The words “we,” “us,” “our,” and the “Company,” refer to General Enterprise Ventures, Inc.  The words or phrases “may,” “will,” “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “approximate,” or “continue,” “would be,” “will allow,” “intends to,” “will likely result,” “are expected to,” “will continue,” “is anticipated,” “estimate,” “project,” or similar expressions, or the negative thereof, are intended to identify “forward-looking statements.”  Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of a number of risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to:  (a) our failure to implement our business plan within the time period we originally planned to accomplish; and (b) other risks that are discussed in this Quarterly Report or included in our previous filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). OVERVIEW Because the Company was dormant from the period from February 2010 through January 2021, the Company used the following methodology to prepare its financial statements. All assets on the Company’s March 31, 2010 balance were deemed disposed of for no value and fully impaired for quarter beginning April 1, 2010. All liabilities outstanding as of March 31, 2010 remained on the Company’s balance sheet accruing interest until the quarter ending March 31, 2017 when they were written off due to the expiration of the Statue of Limitations. As a result no MD&A is being provided.    21   ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Not required ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined  in  Rules  13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the  Exchange  Act (defined  below)). Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered in this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the required time periods and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error or fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Accordingly, management believes that the financial statements included in this report fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. Because the Company was dormant from February 2010 to January 2021 disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2014 are deemed to be ineffective. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  In addition, our management with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have determined that change in our internal control over financial reporting (as that term is defined in Rules 13(a)-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) occurred during or subsequent to the quarter ended June 30, 2014 that internal control over financial reporting is deemed to be ineffective.      22   PART II - OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceeding The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of its business. Although occasional adverse decisions or settlements may occur, the Company believes that the final disposition of such matters will not have material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Item 1A.
