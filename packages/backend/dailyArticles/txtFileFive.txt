Forward-looking statements are predictions, projections and other statements about future events that are based on current expectations and assumptions and, as a result, are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other important factors, many of which are outside of the control of Wheels Up Experience Inc. (“Wheels Up”, or “we”, “us”, or “our”), that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the expectations, hopes, beliefs, intentions or strategies of Wheels Up regarding the future, including, without limitation, statements regarding: (i) the size, demands and growth potential of the markets for Wheels Up’s products and services and Wheels Up’s ability to serve those markets; (ii) the degree of market acceptance and adoption of Wheels Up’s products and services; (iii) Wheels Up’s ability to develop innovative products and services and compete with other companies engaged in the private aviation industry; (iv) Wheels Up’s ability to attract and retain customers; (v) Wheels Up’s liquidity, future cash flows, acquisition activities, measures intended to increase Wheels Up’s operational efficiency and certain restrictions related to our debt obligations; and (vi) general economic and geopolitical conditions, including due to fluctuations in interest rates, inflation, foreign currencies, consumer and business spending decisions, and general levels of economic activity. In addition, any statements that refer to projections, forecasts, or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. The words “anticipate,” “believe,” continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “might,” “plan,” “possible,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “strive,” “would” and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that statement is not forward-looking. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those described in the “Risk Factors” described under Part I, Item 1A in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q/A, and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q/A. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and it is impossible for us to predict these events or how they may affect us. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made, and Wheels Up undertakes no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, changes in expectations, future events or otherwise. These filings identify and address other important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Wheels Up does not give any assurance that Wheels Up will achieve its expectations.               EXPLANATORY NOTE    We are filing this Form 10-Q/A to amend and restate our Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2022, which was originally filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on November 9, 2022 (the “Original Form 10-Q”), to restate our previously issued unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 (the “Prior Financial Statements”), and to amend related disclosures, including regarding controls and procedures.Background of Restatement    On March 31, 2023, we filed a Current Report on Form 8-K under Item 4.02(a) with the SEC relating to the Prior Financial Statements. As indicated in such Current Report on Form 8-K, in connection with the preparation of the audited financial statements to be included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, we determined that a restatement of the Prior Financial Statements was necessary due to the identification of errors related to a non-cash goodwill impairment charge that should have been recognized in the Prior Financial Statements. The Company determined that a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $62 million should have been recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2022. This non-cash goodwill impairment charge resulted in:•a $62.0 million increase to the Company’s Net loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 versus the previously reported financial results;•a revised Net loss of $148.8 million, or $0.61 per share, for the three months ended September 30, 2022, and $330.6 million, or $1.35 per share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2022; and•corresponding adjustments, and associated impacts of the adjustments, to:?the balances of the “Goodwill” and “Accumulated deficit” line items in the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2022;?the balances of “Net loss” and “Impairment of goodwill” in the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2022; and?the balances of “Net loss” and “Impairment of goodwill” and the “Impairment of goodwill” reconciling item in the Company’s reconciliations of Net loss to Adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022.See Note 20, Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements included herein for additional information.Internal Control Considerations    As a result of the restatement of the Company’s financial statements and the filing of this Form 10-Q/A, management has determined that a material weakness existed in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting related to the financial statement close process for the quarter ended September 30, 2022. The identified material weakness is further described in Item 4 within this Form 10-Q/A and the Company’s remediation plan will be described in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. In addition, as a result of the restatement of the Company’s financial statements and the material weakness described above, management has reconsidered its assessment and now concludes that we did not maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures for the quarter ended September 30, 2022.Items Amended in this Form 10-Q/A    For the convenience of the reader, this Form 10-Q/A presents the Original Form 10-Q, amended and restated in its entirety, with modifications as necessary to reflect the effects of the restatement of our previously issued unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. No attempt has been made in this Form 10-Q/A to update other disclosures presented in the Original Form 10-Q, except as required to reflect the effects of such restatement in the following amended items:      •Part I, Item 1. “Financial Statements”•Part I, Item 2. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”•Part I, Item 4. “Controls and Procedures”•Part II, Item 6. “Exhibits”    In addition, this Form 10-Q/A updates the signature page. In accordance with Rule 12b-15 under the Exchange, the Company is also including with this Form 10-Q/A new certifications required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2022 from the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (as principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (as principal financial officer) dated as of the filing date of this Form 10-Q/A (included in Part II, Item 6. “Exhibits” and attached as Exhibits 31.1, 31.2, 32.1, and 32.2). Except as described above, this Form 10-Q/A is presented as of the date of the Original Form 10-Q and does not substantively amend, update or change any other items or disclosures contained in the Original Form 10-Q. Accordingly, this Form 10-Q/A does not reflect or purport to reflect any information or events occurring subsequent to September 30, 2022, the filing date of the Original Form 10-Q, unless specifically noted herein, or otherwise modify or update those disclosures affected by subsequent events, except to the extent they are otherwise required to be included and discussed herein. Among other things, forward-looking statements made in the Original Form 10-Q have not been revised to reflect events, results or developments that occurred or facts that became known to the Company after the date of the Original Form 10-Q, other than the restatement.    Accordingly, this Form 10-Q/A should be read in conjunction with the Company’s filings with the SEC that were made after the filing of the Original Form 10-Q, including any amendments to those filings.           PART I.

   WHEELS UP EXPERIENCE INC.NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Unaudited)1.ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS    Wheels Up Experience Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, “Wheels Up”, the “Company”, “our”, “we”, and “us”) is a leading brand in private aviation that strives to deliver a total private aviation solution.    On July 13, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), we consummated the transactions contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”), dated as of February 1, 2021, as amended on May 6, 2021, by and among Aspirational Consumer Lifestyle Corp., a blank check company originally incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company (“Aspirational”), Wheels Up Partners Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“WUP”), Kittyhawk Merger Sub LLC., a Delaware limited liability company and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Aspirational (“Merger Sub”), Wheels Up Blocker Sub LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Aspirational (“Blocker Sub”), the Blocker Merger Subs (as defined in the Merger Agreement) and the Blockers (as defined in the Merger Agreement). In connection with the closing of the Merger Agreement, Aspirational filed a notice of deregistration with the Cayman Islands Registrar of Companies, together with the necessary accompanying documents, and filed a certificate of incorporation and a certificate of corporate domestication with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, under which Aspirational was domesticated and continues as a Delaware corporation, changing its name to “Wheels Up Experience Inc.” (the “Domestication”).    On the Closing Date, (i) the Blockers simultaneously merged with and into the respective Blocker Merger Subs, with the Blockers surviving each merger as wholly owned subsidiaries of Wheels Up (the “First Step Blocker Mergers”), (ii) thereafter, the surviving Blockers simultaneously merged with and into Blocker Sub, with Blocker Sub surviving each merger (the “Second Step Blocker Mergers”), and (iii) thereafter, Merger Sub merged with and into WUP, with WUP surviving the merger, with Wheels Up as its managing member (the “Company Merger” and collectively with the First Step Blocker Mergers and the Second Step Blocker Mergers, the “Mergers” and, together with the Domestication, the “Business Combination”) (See Note 3).   2.SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation    The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial reporting and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021, has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date, but certain notes or other information that are normally required by U.S. GAAP have been omitted if they substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in our annual audited consolidated financial statements. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Wheels Up Experience Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. We consolidate Wheels Up Partners MIP LLC (“MIP LLC”) and record the profits interests held in MIP LLC that Wheels Up does not own as non-controlling interests (see Note 14). All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.    Certain information and footnote disclosure normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to instructions, rules and regulations prescribed by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). In the opinion of management, the unaudited financial information for the interim periods presented reflects all adjustments, which are normal and recurring, necessary for a fair presentation of the consolidated statement of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Interim results should not be regarded as indicative of results that may be expected for any other period or the entire year. The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.8    Use of Estimates    Preparing the condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates due to risks and uncertainties, including uncertainty in the current economic environment due to the coronavirus pandemic, and any evolutions thereof (“COVID-19”). The most significant estimates include, but are not limited to, the useful lives and residual values of purchased aircraft, the fair value of financial assets and liabilities, acquired intangible assets, goodwill, contingent consideration, and other assets and liabilities, sales and use tax, the estimated life of member relationships, the determination of the allowance for credit losses, impairment assessments, the determination of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and the incremental borrowing rate for leases.    Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments    Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, where the functional currency is not the United States (“U.S.”) dollar, have been translated at period-end exchange rates and profit and loss accounts have been translated using weighted-average exchange rates. Adjustments resulting from currency translation have been recorded in the equity section of the condensed consolidated balance sheets and the condensed consolidated statements of other comprehensive loss as a cumulative translation adjustment.    Interim Impairment Test (As Restated)    During the second quarter of 2022, we determined that because of a sustained decrease in the quoted market price of our Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Class A common stock”), from the Closing Date, combined with a further decline in our operating margins, there was an indication that a triggering event occurred and the carrying value of our long-lived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable associated with the legacy Wheels Up reporting unit (“WUP Legacy”). As a result, we performed an undiscounted cash flow analysis of our long-lived assets for potential impairment as of June 1, 2022, and based on the analysis, it was determined that there was no impairment to our long-lived assets. In addition, we performed an interim quantitative impairment assessment of goodwill on June 1, 2022, using a discounted cash flow approach, which did not result in impairment to goodwill.    During the third quarter of 2022, we determined that because of continued deterioration in our stock price, resulting in a market capitalization that was below the carrying value of our equity, there was an indication that a triggering event occurred and the carrying value of WUP Legacy may not be recoverable. As a result, we performed a quantitative impairment test using the income approach. The fair value using the income approach was based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. The significant underlying unobservable inputs used to measure the fair value included forecasted revenue growth rates and margins, weighted average cost of capital, normalized working capital level and projected long-term growth rates. As a result of this assessment, a goodwill impairment charge of $62.0 million was recorded to WUP Legacy as of September 30, 2022. The decline in the fair value of the reporting unit, as compared to the quantitative analysis performed as of June 1, 2022, was primarily due to an increase in the discount rate.    Correction of an Immaterial Error    During the fourth quarter of 2021, we identified an immaterial error related to the accounting for equity as part of the reverse recapitalization (see Note 3) that resulted in an understatement of our accumulated deficit and an overstatement of additional paid-in capital by $32.7 million as of December 31, 2020. The error had no impact on our total equity or our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.    We assessed the materiality of the error on our consolidated financial statements for prior periods and concluded that they were not material. We have corrected the error by adjusting the prior period consolidated financial statements.    Adopted Accounting Pronouncements9    In October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued accounting standards update (“ASU”) 2021-08, Business Combinations: Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers (ASC 805). This standard simplifies the measurement and recognition of contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers acquired in a business combination. This guidance will generally result in the recognition of contract assets and contract liabilities consistent with those reported by the acquiree immediately before the acquisition date. We adopted ASU 2021-08 on January 1, 2022. This adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.   103.BUSINESS COMBINATION    The Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization, where Aspirational was treated as the acquired company for financial reporting purposes. This accounting treatment is the equivalent of Wheels Up issuing stock for the net assets of Aspirational, accompanied by a recapitalization whereby no goodwill or other intangible assets are recorded. Accordingly, WUP is deemed the accounting predecessor of the combined business, and Wheels Up, as the parent company of the combined business, is the successor SEC registrant, meaning that all historical financial information presented in the condensed consolidated financial statements prior to the closing of the Business Combination represents the accounts of WUP.    Upon closing of the Business Combination, all outstanding WUP common interests and WUP preferred interests (including WUP restricted interests), as well as shares underlying WUP options, were converted into 190.0 million shares of Class A common stock and rolled over into the combined business. In addition, there were 29.0 million outstanding WUP profits interests recapitalized in connection with the Business Combination that can be exchanged on a value-for-value basis for Class A common stock subject to vesting.    Upon closing of the Business Combination, Aspirational and Aspirational’s public shareholders held 6.0 million and 10.6 million shares, respectively, of Class A common stock.    All references to numbers of common shares and per common share data prior to the Business Combination in these condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes have been retroactively adjusted to account for the effect of the reverse recapitalization. The reported share and per share amounts, have been converted by applying the exchange ratio established in the Merger Agreement of 0.4604, which was based on the Wheels Up implied price per share prior to the Business Combination (the “Exchange Ratio”). On the Closing Date, we received approximately $656.3 million in gross proceeds. In connection with the Business Combination, we incurred $70.4 million of transaction costs, consisting of advisory, legal, share registration and other professional fees, which are recorded within additional paid-in capital as a reduction of proceeds.    PIPE Investment    In connection with the Business Combination, Aspirational entered into subscription agreements with certain investors (the “PIPE Investors”), whereby Aspirational issued 55.0 million shares of common stock at a price of $10.00 per share (the “PIPE Shares”) for an aggregate purchase price of $550.0 million (the “PIPE Investment”), which closed simultaneously with the consummation of the Business Combination. On the Closing Date, the PIPE Shares were automatically converted into shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis.    Earnout Shares    Further, as part of the Business Combination, existing holders of WUP equity, including holders of profits interests and restricted interests, but excluding holders of stock options, have the right to receive up to an aggregate of 9,000,000 additional shares of Class A common stock in three equal tranches, which are issuable upon the achievement of Class A common stock share price thresholds of $12.50, $15.00, and $17.50 for any 20 trading days within a period of 30 consecutive trading days within five years of the Closing Date, respectively (the “Earnout Shares”).    Public Warrants and Private Warrants    The warrants assumed in the Business Combination include (i) 7,991,544 redeemable warrants sold by Aspirational as part of its initial public offering (the “Public Warrants”) of 23,974,362 units, consisting of one share of Class A common stock and one-third of one warrant exercisable for Class A common stock and (ii) 4,529,950 warrants privately sold by Aspirational at a price of $1.50 per warrant (the “Private Warrants”) to Aspirational Consumer Lifestyle Sponsor LLC (the “Sponsor”) simultaneously with the closing of the Aspirational initial public offering exercisable for Class A common stock.   114.     PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT    Property and equipment consist of the following (in thousands):   September 30, 2022December 31, 2021Aircraft$559,505 $482,848 Software development costs55,269 35,818 Leasehold improvements10,012 12,584 Computer equipment2,476 2,147 Buildings and improvements1,424 1,424 Furniture and fixtures3,039 1,960 Tooling3,613 3,129 Vehicles1,461 1,142 636,799 541,052 Less: Accumulated depreciation and amortization(248,997)(223,216)Total$387,802 $317,836     Depreciation and amortization expense of property and equipment was $10.6 million and $30.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, and $8.4 million and $26.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively.    Capitalized costs related to the internal development of software was $5.6 million and $18.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, and $3.9 million and $9.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively.    Amortization expense related to software development costs, included as part of depreciation and amortization expense of property and equipment, was $3.6 million and $9.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, and $1.8 million and $4.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively.   125.     REVENUE    Disaggregation of Revenue    The following table disaggregates revenue by service type and the timing of when these services are provided to the member or customer (in thousands):   Three Months Ended September 30,Nine Months Ended September 30,2022202120222021Services transferred at a point in time:Flights, net of discounts and incentives$278,917 $218,360 $799,351 $621,494 Aircraft management56,558 55,388 172,914 151,405 Other58,728 6,679 121,695 16,418 Services transferred over time:Memberships22,409 17,982 67,076 49,144 Aircraft management2,404 2,617 7,272 7,435 Other1,340 952 3,195 3,319 Total$420,356 $301,978 $1,171,503 $849,215     Revenue in the condensed consolidated statements of operations is presented net of discounts and incentives of $2.7 million and $9.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, and $5.0 million and $12.5 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021.    Included in services transferred at a point in time, Other, is revenue related to whole aircraft sales of $35.9 million and $63.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively.    Contract Balances    Receivables from member and customer contracts are included within accounts receivable, net on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

Alante Air added 12 Light jets to our controlled fleet and expands our presence in the Western U.S. Acquisition-related costs for Alante Air of $0.5 million were included in general and administrative expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The acquisition of Alante Air was determined to be a business combination.    We have allocated the purchase price for Alante Air to its individual assets and liabilities assumed. While the purchase price allocation is substantially complete, it is still preliminary and subject to change. As of the date of acquisition, the total preliminary purchase price allocated to the Alante Air assets acquired and liabilities assumed according to their estimated fair values were as follows (in thousands):   Current assets$4,452 Goodwill13,069 Other assets22,048 Total assets acquired39,569 Total liabilities assumed(24,101)Net assets acquired$15,468     Current assets of Alante Air included $3.0 million of cash and $1.4 million of accounts receivable, including $15 thousand owed from Wheels Up that was eliminated in consolidation upon acquisition.14    Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the acquired net tangible assets. The allocated value of goodwill primarily relates to anticipated synergies and economies of scale by combining the use of Alante Air’s aircraft and existing business processes with our other acquisitions. The acquired goodwill is deductible for tax purposes.    The results of Alante Air were included in the condensed consolidated statement of operations from the date of acquisition. Revenue for Alante Air was $2.9 million, net of intercompany eliminations, and loss from operations was $24.2 million from the date of acquisition through September 30, 2022.    Air Partner plc Acquisition    On April 1, 2022, we acquired all of the outstanding equity of Air Partner plc (“Air Partner”) for a total purchase price of $108.2 million in cash. Air Partner is a United Kingdom-based international aviation services group that provides us with operations in 18 locations across four continents. Acquisition-related costs for Air Partner of $2.9 million were included in general and administrative expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The acquisition of Air Partner was determined to be a business combination.    As of the date of acquisition, the total preliminary purchase price allocated to the Air Partner assets acquired and liabilities assumed according to their estimated fair values were as follows (in thousands):   Current assets$51,723 Property and equipment, net2,012 Operating lease right-of-use assets2,960 Goodwill83,399 Intangible assets20,919 Restricted cash27,507 Other assets1,536 Total assets acquired190,056 Total liabilities assumed(81,865)Net assets acquired$108,191     Current assets of Air Partner included $18.0 million of cash and $17.4 million of accounts receivable.    The above initial fair value estimates of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are provisional. We are still evaluating the fair value of intangible assets, and income taxes, in addition to ensuring all other assets, liabilities and contingencies have been identified and recorded. We have estimated the preliminary fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on information currently available and will continue to adjust those estimates as additional information pertaining to events or circumstances present at the acquisition date becomes available during the measurement period.    The allocated value of goodwill primarily relates to anticipated synergies and economies of scale by combining the use of Air Partner’s existing business processes with our platform to expand on an international basis. The acquired goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.15    The amounts allocated to acquired intangible assets and their associated weighted-average amortization periods, which were determined based on the period the assets are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our cash flows, consist of the following:   Amount(In thousands)Weighted-Average Amortization Period(Years)Customer relationships$16,521 5.7Backlog1,457 1.5Trade name1,930 1.9Developed technology1,011 5.8Total acquired intangible assets$20,919 5.1    The intangible asset fair value measurements are primarily based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market which represent a Level 3 measurement (see Note 9). The valuation method used for the Air Partner intangible assets was the income approach.    The results of Air Partner were included in the condensed consolidated statement of operations from the date of acquisition. Revenue for Air Partner was $65.0 million, net of intercompany eliminations, and income from operations was $6.6 million from the date of acquisition through September 30, 2022.    Unaudited Pro Forma Summary of Operations    The accompanying unaudited pro forma summary represents the consolidated results of operations as if the 2021 acquisition of Mountain Aviation, LLC had been completed as of January 1, 2021 and the 2022 acquisitions of Alante Air and Air Partner had been completed as of January 1, 2021. The unaudited pro forma financial results for 2022 reflect the results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, as well as the effects of pro forma adjustments for the transactions in 2022. The unaudited pro forma financial information includes the accounting effects of the acquisitions, including adjustments to the amortization of intangible assets and professional fees associated with the transactions. The pro forma results were based on estimates and assumptions, which we believe are reasonable but remain subject to adjustment. The unaudited pro forma summary does not necessarily reflect the actual results that would have been achieved had the companies been combined during the periods presented, nor is it necessarily indicative of future consolidated results (in thousands, except per share data).   Three Months Ended September 30,Nine Months Ended September 30,2022202120222021Net revenue$420,356 $344,291 $1,209,321 $949,405 Net loss$(87,507)$(54,046)$(266,628)$(115,279)Net loss attributable to Wheels Up Experience Inc.$(87,507)$(53,289)$(266,628)$(109,400)Net loss per share$(0.61)$(0.25)$(1.35)$(0.60)   167.    GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS (AS RESTATED)    Goodwill    The change in the carrying value of goodwill for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, was as follows (in thousands):   Balance as of December 31, 2021$437,398 Acquisition of Alante Air13,069 Acquisition of Air Partner83,399 Impairment of goodwill(1)(62,000)Foreign currency translation adjustments(12,019)Balance as of September 30, 2022$459,847 __________________1)    Represents a non-cash impairment charge related to goodwill realized in the third quarter of 2022.

In addition, as of September 30, 2022, restricted cash also included $20.1 million related to cash received from customers for Air Partner jet cards. Air Partner jet cards do not have an expiration date18and are refundable upon demand by the customer. As such, we are contractually and legally restricted from using Air Partner jet card deposits.    A reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash from the condensed consolidated balance sheets to the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows was as follows (in thousands):   September 30, 2022September 30, 2021Cash and cash equivalents$285,498 $535,253 Restricted cash26,416 2,177 Total$311,914 $537,430    9.    FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS    Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability, an exit price, in an orderly transaction between unaffiliated willing market participants on the measurement date under current market conditions. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured and classified in accordance with a three-tier fair value hierarchy based on the observability of the inputs available and activity in the markets used to measure fair value. A financial instrument’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.   Level 1 -Quoted prices, unadjusted, in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that can be accessed at the measurement date.Level 2 -Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.Level 3 -Unobservable inputs developed using our own estimates and assumptions, which reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.19    Financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and their corresponding placement in the fair value hierarchy consisted of the following (in thousands):   September 30, 2022Level 1Level 2Level 3Fair ValueAssets:Cash equivalents$162,392 $— $— $162,392 Liabilities:Warrant liability - Public Warrants1,278 — — 1,278 Warrant liability - Private Warrants— 725 — 725 Total liabilities$1,278 $725 $— $2,003 December 31, 2021Level 1Level 2Level 3Fair ValueAssets:Cash equivalents$408,082 $— $— $408,082 Liabilities:Warrant liability - Public Warrants6,553 — — 6,553 Warrant liability - Private Warrants— 3,715 — 3,715 Total liabilities$6,553 $3,715 $— $10,268     The carrying amount of cash equivalents approximates fair value and is classified within Level 1, because we determined the fair value through quoted market prices.    The warrants were accounted for as a liability in accordance with ASC 815-40 (see Note 18). The warrant liability was measured at fair value upon assumption and on a recurring basis, with changes in fair value presented in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.    As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we used Level 1 inputs for the Public Warrants and Level 2 inputs for the Private Warrants. We valued the Private Warrants by applying the valuation technique of a Monte Carlo simulation model to reflect the redemption conditions. The Private Warrants are substantially similar to the Public Warrants, but not directly traded or quoted on an active trading market.    The following table presents the changes in the fair value of the warrant liability (in thousands):   Public WarrantsPrivate WarrantsTotalWarrant LiabilityFair value as of December 31, 2021$6,553 $3,715 $10,268 Change in fair value of warrant liability(5,275)(2,990)(8,265)Fair value as of September 30, 2022$1,278 $725 $2,003 10.    LONG-TERM DEBT    On July 21, 2021, in connection with proceeds received from the Business Combination, we repaid substantially all of the outstanding principal of our long-term debt, together with all accrued and unpaid interest in the amount of $175.5 million.20    Our credit facilities contained certain restrictive covenants. We satisfied these covenants for all periods presented during which we were subject to such covenants.    Amortization expense for debt discounts and deferred financing costs was $0 for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and $0 and $0.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, which was recorded in interest expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.   11.    COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES    Legal Proceedings    We are party to various legal actions arising in the normal course of business. While we do not expect that the ultimate resolution of any of these pending actions will have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties. As such, there can be no assurance that any pending legal action, which we believe to be immaterial as of September 30, 2022, does not become material in the future.    Sales and Use Tax Liability    We regularly provide services to members in various states within the continental U.S., which may create sales and use tax nexus via temporary presence, potentially requiring the payment of these taxes. We determined that there is uncertainty as to what constitutes nexus in respective states for a state to levy taxes, fees and surcharges relating to our activity. As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we estimate the potential exposure to such tax liability to be $9.9 million and $7.9 million, respectively, the expense for which is included in accrued expenses on the condensed consolidated balance sheets and cost of revenue in the condensed consolidated statements of operations as of and for the applicable periods presented.   12.    LEASES    Leases primarily pertain to certain controlled aircraft, corporate headquarters, and operational facilities, including aircraft hangars, which are primarily accounted for as operating leases. We sublease the corporate headquarters from a third party and sublease the aircraft hangar at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport from Delta Air Lines, Inc. (“Delta”).    We have certain variable lease agreements with aircraft owners that contain payment terms based on an hourly lease rate multiplied by the number of flight hours during a month. Variable lease payments were $3.6 million and $12.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, and $3.2 million and $12.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively.    The components of net lease cost were as follows (in thousands):   Three Months Ended September 30,Nine Months Ended September 30,2022202120222021Operating lease costs$9,789 $12,643 $28,614 $29,900 Short-term lease costs8,086 3,331 22,600 16,139 Total lease costs$17,875 $15,974 $51,214 $46,039     Costs related to leased aircraft and operational facilities were $15.0 million and $43.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, and $14.0 million and $40.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, and are included in cost of revenue in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Costs related to leased corporate headquarters and other office space including expenses for non-lease components were $2.9 million and $7.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, and $2.0 million and $5.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021,21respectively, and are included in general and administrative expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.    Supplemental cash flow information related to leases were as follows (in thousands):   Nine Months Ended September 30,20222021Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities:Operating cash flows paid for operating leases$28,865 $27,773 Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for operating lease obligations$46,916 $62,856     Supplemental balance sheet information related to leases are as follows:   September 30, 2022December 31, 2021Weighted-average remaining lease term (in years):Operating leases5.86.4Weighted-average discount rate:Operating leases9.0 %9.5 %    Maturities of lease liabilities, as of September 30, 2022, were as follows (in thousands):   Year ending December 31,Operating Leases2022 (excluding the nine months ended September 30, 2022)$10,074 202338,557 202433,090 202519,384 202611,230 Thereafter42,441 Total lease payments154,776 Less: Imputed interest(37,698)Total lease obligations$117,078 13.    STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY AND EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION    Pursuant to the Wheels Up Experience Inc. certificate of incorporation, we are authorized to issue 2,500,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, par value of $0.0001 per share, and 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share. Holders of Class A common stock are entitled to one vote per share.    As of September 30, 2022, we have the following nine equity-based compensation plans that were approved by the board of directors of WUP prior to the Business Combination: Wheels Up Partners Holdings LLC Equity Incentive Plan (“MIP Plan”); Wheels Up Partners Holdings LLC Equity Incentive Plan II (“MIP Plan II”); Wheels Up Partners Holdings LLC Equity Incentive Plan III (“MIP Plan III”); Wheels Up Partners Holdings LLC Equity Incentive Plan IV (“MIP Plan IV”); Wheels Up Partners Holdings LLC Equity Incentive Plan V (“MIP Plan V”); Wheels Up Partners Holdings LLC Equity Incentive Plan VI (“MIP Plan VI”); Wheels Up Partners Holdings LLC Equity Incentive Plan VII (“MIP Plan VII”); and Wheels Up Partners Holdings LLC Equity Incentive Plan VIII (“MIP Plan VIII”); which collectively constitute the management incentive plan and the Wheels Up Partners Holdings LLC Option Plan, which is the WUP stock option plan. Following the consummation of the Business Combination, no new grants can be made under the WUP management incentive plan or the WUP stock option plan.22    In connection with the Business Combination, the board of directors (the “Board”) and stockholders of Wheels Up adopted the Wheels Up Experience Inc. 2021 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2021 LTIP”), for employees, consultants and other qualified persons.    On June 30, 2022, the Board adopted the Wheels Up Experience Inc. 2022 Inducement Grant Plan (the “2022 Inducement Plan”) to be used for a one-time employment inducement grant for our new Chief Financial Officer, Todd Smith, pursuant to New York Stock Exchange Rule 303A.08. The maximum number of awards that could be granted under the 2022 Inducement Plan were 2,051,282 shares of Class A common stock, which were all granted in the form of RSUs to Mr. Smith on July 1, 2022. The RSUs granted under the 2022 Inducement Plan are subject to time-based vesting and will vest ratably on December 30, 2022, December 30, 2023 and December 30, 2024, respectively, in each case subject to Mr. Smith’s continued employment with Wheels Up through the vesting date.WUP Management Incentive Plan    WUP Profits Interests    As of September 30, 2022, an aggregate of 31.3 million profits interests have been authorized and issued under the WUP management incentive plan.    The following table summarizes the profits interests activity under the WUP management incentive plan as of September 30, 2022:    Number of WUPProfits InterestsWeighted-Average GrantDate Fair Value (in thousands)Outstanding WUP profits interests as of January 1, 202228,819 $0.42 Granted— — Exchanged— — Expired/forfeited(6)0.24 Outstanding WUP profits interests as of September 30, 202228,813 $0.42     The weighted-average remaining contractual term as of September 30, 2022, for WUP profits interests outstanding was approximately 8.8 years.    The following table summarizes the status of non-vested WUP profits interests as of September 30, 2022:    Number of WUPProfits InterestsWeighted-Average GrantDate Fair Value (in thousands)Non-vested WUP profits interests as of January 1, 20224,733 $0.35 Granted— — Vested(3,029)0.31 Forfeited(6)0.24 Non-vested WUP profits interests as of September 30, 20221,698 $0.42     The total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested WUP profits interests was $0.3 million as of September 30, 2022 and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 0.5 years. The total fair value for WUP profits interests that vested was approximated $1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022.    WUP Restricted Interests23    As of September 30, 2022, under MIP Plan VII, 4.7 million WUP restricted interests have been authorized and issued to certain current and former Wheels Up employees.    The following table summarizes the restricted interests activity under the WUP management incentive plan as of September 30, 2022:   Number of WUP Restricted InterestsWeighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value(in thousands)Non-vested WUP restricted interests as of January 1, 20224,662 $3.98 Granted— — Vested(4,662)3.98 Forfeited— — Non-vested WUP restricted interests as of September 30, 2022— $—     The weighted-average remaining contractual term as of September 30, 2022, for WUP restricted interests outstanding was approximately 7.5 years.    The total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested WUP restricted interests was $0 as of September 30, 2022. WUP restricted interests are time and performance-based awards that vest with a change in control or initial public offering. As a result, we started recording compensation cost for WUP restricted interests on the Closing Date. The total fair value for WUP restricted interests that vested was approximated $18.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022.    The WUP restricted interests granted vest when both of the following conditions exist: (i) ratably over a four-year service period and (ii) upon the first to occur of (A) a change of control and (B) the later to occur of (1) six months after an initial public offering and (2) 30 days after the expiration of any applicable lock-up period in connection with an initial public offering. The WUP restricted interests lock-up period expired on February 8, 2022. As of such date, the holders of WUP restricted interests met the vesting conditions for the portion of their awards that did not require further service. The remainder of such eligible vestings occurred prior to filing this Form 10-Q/A.WUP Stock Option Plan    As of September 30, 2022, the number of WUP stock options authorized and issued in aggregate under the WUP stock option plan was 17.5 million.

We recognize compensation expense over the vesting period of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest when the achievement of the related performance objectives becomes probable. The total grant date fair value of unvested PSUs as of September 30, 2022 was $1.9 million. As of September 30, 2022, the achievement of the related performance objective was not probable of being achieved and, accordingly, no compensation cost for the PSUs has been recognized.    2022 CEO Awards    During the second quarter of 2022, the Board approved certain grants under the 2021 LTIP to our CEO consisting of 1,600,000 RSUs that contain a service-based vesting condition (the “CEO Service-Based RSUs”), 380,000 PSUs that contain performance-based vesting conditions (the “CEO PSUs”) and 1,615,000 RSUs that contain market-based vesting conditions (the “CEO Market-Based RSUs”, together with the CEO Service-Based RSUs and CEO PSUs, the “2022 CEO Awards”). All of the 2022 CEO Awards require continued employment through the vesting date, subject to specified change in control and service termination exceptions. The CEO Service-Based RSUs vest annually over a three-year period from the grant date. The CEO Service-Based RSUs are included in the table under “—Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”)” above as of September 30, 2022.    The CEO PSUs will vest, if at all, with the achievement of certain separate performance conditions based on the achievement of pre-determined annual revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization thresholds. Any CEO PSUs that have not vested prior to the date the audited financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2026 are finalized will be forfeited. The CEO PSUs are included in the table under “—Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units (“PSUs”)” above as of September 30, 2022.    The CEO Market-Based RSUs will vest, if at all, with the achievement of certain separate market-based vesting conditions based on the closing Class A common stock price over any 30 consecutive trading day-period that occurs prior to December 31, 2026. The CEO Market-Based RSUs are in addition to those described in the tables above under “—Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”)” and “—Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units (“PSUs”)”.    As of September 30, 2022, none of the CEO PSUs had vested and 133,333 CEO PSUs had a performance-based vesting condition deemed probable of being achieved. The total unrecognized compensation cost related to such CEO PSUs with a probable performance-based vesting condition was $0.3 million as of September 30, 2022 and is expected to be recognized over 0.6 years.    The grant-date fair value of the CEO Market-Based RSUs, using a Monte Carlo simulation model, was $0.3 million. The derived service period for such CEO Market-Based RSUs began on June 8, 2022 and is a weighted-average period of 3.8 years.26    Based on the Class A common stock trading price, the market conditions for the CEO Market-Based RSUs were not met, and no shares vested as of September 30, 2022. The total unrecognized compensation cost related to such CEO Market-Based RSUs was $0.2 million as of September 30, 2022 and is expected to be recognized over 3.5 years.    Wheels Up Stock Options    The following table summarizes the activity under the 2021 LTIP related to Wheels Up stock options as of September 30, 2022:   Number of Wheels UpStock OptionsWeighted-Average ExercisePriceWeighted-Average GrantDate Fair Value(in thousands)Outstanding Wheels Up stock options as of January 1, 2022921 $10.00 $4.75 Granted— — — Exercised— — — Forfeited— — — Expired— — — Outstanding Wheels Up stock options as of September 30, 2022921 $10.00 $4.75 Exercisable Wheels Up stock options as of September 30, 2022384 $10.00 $4.75     The aggregate intrinsic value as of September 30, 2022, for Wheels Up stock options that were outstanding and exercisable was $0.    The weighted-average remaining contractual term as of September 30, 2022, for Wheels Up stock options that were outstanding and exercisable was approximately 8.8 years and 8.8 years, respectively.    The following table summarizes the status of non-vested Wheels Up stock options as of September 30, 2022:    Number of Wheels Up Stock OptionsWeighted-Average GrantDate Fair Value (in thousands)Non-vested Wheels Up stock options as of January 1, 2022768 $4.75 Granted— — Vested(230)4.75 Expired— — Forfeited— — Non-vested Wheels Up stock options as of September 30, 2022538 $4.75     The total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested Wheels Up stock options was $2.3 million as of September 30, 2022 and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.6 years. The total fair value of Wheels Up stock options that vested was approximated $1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022.    Equity-Based Compensation Expense    Compensation expense for WUP profits interests recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations was $0.2 million and $1.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, and $1.0 million and $1.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively.27    Compensation expense for WUP restricted interests recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations was $0 and $0.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, and $12.6 million for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021.    Compensation expense for WUP stock options and Wheels Up stock options recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations was $1.3 million and $5.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, and $5.4 million and $7.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively.    Compensation expense for RSUs recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations was $11.2 million and $29.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, and $0.6 million for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021.    The following table summarizes equity-based compensation expense recognized by condensed consolidated statement of operations line item (in thousands):   Three Months Ended September 30,Nine Months Ended September 30,2022202120222021Cost of revenue$3,581 $679 $11,320 $779 Technology and development751 619 2,047 806 Sales and marketing2,756 2,449 8,314 2,901 General and administrative15,416 24,159 44,158 26,182 Total equity-based compensation expense$22,504 $27,906 $65,839 $30,668 Earnout Shares    The 9,000,000 Earnout Shares vest with the achievement of separate market conditions. One-third of the Earnout Shares will meet the market condition when the closing Class A common stock price is greater than or equal to $12.50 for any 20 trading days within a period of 30 consecutive trading days within five years of the Closing Date. An additional one-third will vest when the Class A common stock is greater than or equal to $15.00 over the same measurement period. The final one-third will vest when the Class A common stock is greater than or equal to $17.50 over the same measurement period.    Earnout Shares that are attributable to WUP profits interests and restricted interests require continued employment as of the date on which each of the Earnout Share market conditions are met. As of September 30, 2022 forfeitures of Earnout Shares were not material.    The grant-date fair value of the Earnout Shares attributable to the holders of WUP profits interests and restricted interests, using a Monte Carlo simulation model, was $57.9 million. The derived service period began on the Closing Date and is a weighted-average period of 1.7 years.    Based on the Class A common stock trading price, the market conditions were not met, and no Earnout Shares vested as of September 30, 2022. Compensation expense for Earnout Shares recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations was $9.7 million and $28.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, and $8.3 million for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. The total unrecognized compensation cost related to Earnout Shares was $11.1 million as of September 30, 2022 and is expected to be recognized over 0.5 years.Treasury Stock    During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, 473,339 and 2,386,585 shares, with a market value of $0.7 million and $7.3 million, respectively, or $1.39 and $3.47 per share, respectively, were withheld to settle employee taxes due upon the vesting of either restricted stock or RSUs and were added to treasury stock on our condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2022.28   14.    NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS (AS RESTATED)    MIP LLC is a single purpose entity formed for the purpose of administering and effectuating the award of WUP profits interests to employees, consultants and other qualified persons. Wheels Up is the sole managing member of MIP LLC and, as a result, consolidates the financial results of MIP LLC. We record non-controlling interests representing the ownership interest in MIP LLC held by other members of MIP LLC. In connection with the Business Combination, the Seventh Amended and Restated LLC Agreement of WUP was adopted, allowing members of MIP LLC, subject to certain restrictions, to exchange their vested WUP profits interests for cash or a corresponding number of shares of Class A common stock, at the option of Wheels Up, based on the value of such WUP profits interests relative to their applicable participation threshold.    The decision of whether to exchange WUP profits interests for cash or Class A common stock is made solely at the discretion of Wheels Up. Accordingly, the WUP profits interests held by MIP LLC are treated as permanent equity and changes in the ownership interest of MIP LLC are accounted for as equity transactions. Future exchanges of WUP profits interests, if settled in Class A common stock at the discretion of Wheels Up, will reduce the amount recorded as non-controlling interests and increase additional paid-in-capital on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.    The calculation of non-controlling interests was as follows:   September 30, 2022As RestatedDecember 31, 2021Number of WUP common units held by Wheels Up(1)245,745,014 100.0 %245,834,569 99.2 %Number of vested WUP profits interests attributable to non-controlling interests(2)— %— %2,045,995 0.8 %Total WUP common units and vested WUP profits interests outstanding245,745,014 100.0 %247,880,564 100.0 %(1) WUP common units represent an equivalent ownership of Class A common stock outstanding.(2) Based on the closing price of Class A common stock on the last trading day of the period covered by this Form 10-Q/A, there would be 0 WUP common units issuable upon conversion of vested and unvested WUP profits interests outstanding as of September 30, 2022.    Weighted-average ownership percentages are used to allocate net loss to Wheels Up and the non-controlling interest holders. The non-controlling interests weighted-average ownership percentage was 0.0% and 0.0% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, and 1.4% and 5.1% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively.        15.    RELATED PARTIES    We engage in transactions with certain stockholders who are also members, ambassadors or customers. Such transactions primarily relate to their membership in the Wheels Up program, flights and flight-related services.    We incurred expenses of $0.1 and $1.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, and $1.4 million and $3.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, from transactions related to a commercial cooperation agreement with our stockholder Delta. We have also recorded $3.2 and $5.3 million in accrued expenses on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, for transactions associated with the commercial cooperation agreement. In addition, we provided $0.5 million and $1.9 million of flights to certain persons currently and previously affiliated with Delta at a discount to our retail pricing for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, and $0.4 million and $1.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively. Delta provided Wheels Up Private Jets pilots airfare for business travel at no cost for all periods presented.    We incurred expenses of $0.1 million and $0.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, and $0.2 million and $0.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, for an aircraft leased from an employee. We recognized revenue of $1.3 million and $3.9 million for29flights and other services, including aircraft management, provided to Board members for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, and $0 and $0.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively. We incurred expenses of $0 for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, and $0 for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, for an immediate family member of a Wheels Up executive and a member of the Board who was a full-time employee. We incurred marketing expenses of $0 and $0.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, and $0 for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, with a company where a member of the Board is an executive.   16.    NET LOSS PER SHARE (AS RESTATED)    The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share (in thousands, except per share data):   Three Months Ended September 30,Nine Months Ended September 30,2022As Restated20212022As Restated2021Numerator:Net loss attributable to Wheels Up Experience Inc. - basic and diluted$(148,838)$(58,485)$(330,250)$(114,050)Denominator:Weighted-average shares of Class A common stock outstanding - basic and diluted244,351 235,341 244,348 191,057 Basic and diluted net loss per share of Class A common stock$(0.61)$(0.25)$(1.35)$(0.60)    There were no dividends declared or paid for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 or 2021.    Basic and diluted net loss per share were computed using the two-class method. Shares of unvested restricted stock are considered participating securities, because these awards contain a non-forfeitable right to participate equally in any dividends prior to forfeiture of the restricted stock, if any, irrespective of whether the awards ultimately vest. All issued and outstanding shares of restricted stock are included in the weighted-average shares of Class A common stock outstanding.    WUP profits interests held by other members of MIP LLC are not subject to the net loss per share calculation until such time the vested WUP profits interests are actually exchanged for shares of Class A common stock.    The following securities were not included in the computation of diluted shares outstanding, because the effect would be anti-dilutive, and issuance of such shares is contingent upon the satisfaction of certain conditions which were not satisfied by the end of the period:   Three Months Ended September 30,Nine Months Ended September 30,2022202120222021Warrants12,521,494 10,870,308 12,521,494 3,623,436 Earnout Shares9,000,000 7,813,187 9,000,000 2,604,396 RSUs(1)24,327,885 836,499 24,327,885 279,858 Stock options14,150,655 16,879,379 14,150,655 16,463,474 Total anti-dilutive securities60,000,034 36,399,373 60,000,034 22,971,164 (1) Includes RSUs, PSUs and CEO Market-Based RSUs outstanding as of September 30, 2022.   3017.    INCOME TAXES    We are subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes with respect to our allocable share of any taxable income or loss from WUP, as well as any standalone income or loss Wheels Up generates. WUP is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal and most applicable state and local income tax purposes and generally does not pay income taxes in most jurisdictions. Instead, any taxable income or loss generated by WUP is passed through to and included in the taxable income or loss of its members, including Wheels Up.    As a result of the Air Partner acquisition, we now conduct business in various foreign jurisdictions and are subject to tax in those foreign jurisdictions. We currently expect the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested. Accordingly, the Company has not provided for the tax effect, if any, of limited outside basis differences of its foreign subsidiaries. The determination of the future tax consequences of the remittance of these earnings is not practicable.    We recorded income tax expense of $0.2 million and $0.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, and $0 for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. The effective tax rate was (0.2)% and (0.2)% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, and 0% for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. Our effective tax rate for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, differs from the federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to a full valuation allowance against the majority of our net deferred tax assets where it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. For the periods prior to the Business Combination, there is no income tax expense recorded because WUP is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal tax purposes and is not subject to U.S. federal and most applicable state and local income taxes.    We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and establish valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets may not be realized. In making such a determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, and tax-planning strategies. As of September 30, 2022, we concluded, based on the weight of all available positive and negative evidence, that it is more likely than not that the U.S. deferred tax assets will not be realized. Accordingly, a full valuation allowance has been established on the majority of our net deferred tax assets in the U.S.    Additionally, the Company is subject to the income tax effects associated with the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) provisions and treats the tax effects of GILTI as a current period expense in the period incurred.   18.    WARRANTS    Prior to the Business Combination, Aspirational issued 7,991,544 Public Warrants and 4,529,950 Private Warrants. On the Closing Date, Wheels Up assumed the warrants. Each whole warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share. The Public Warrants and Private Warrants became exercisable on September 25, 2021, which was 12 months from the closing of the Aspirational initial public offering, and expire five years from the completion of the Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.    In connection with the Business Combination, we filed a Registration Statement on Form S-1 that was declared effective by the SEC on August 24, 2021, as amended by Post-Effective Amendment No. 1 thereto that was declared effective by the SEC on March 21, 2022, as further amended by Post-Effective Amendment No. 2 to Form S-1 on Form S-3 filed with the SEC on July 20, 2022, and as further amended by Post-Effective Amendment No. 3 to Form S-1 on Form S-3 that was declared effective by the SEC on August 10, 2022 (collectively, the “Selling Stockholder Registration Statement”). The Selling Stockholder Registration Statement relates to the issuance of an aggregate of 12,521,494 shares of Class A common stock underlying the Public Warrants and Private Warrants. As of September 30, 2022, there have not been any warrants exercised and 12,521,494 remain outstanding.   3119.    SUBSEQUENT EVENTS    On October 14, 2022, Wheels Up Partners LLC (“WUP LLC”), an indirect subsidiary of the Company, entered into a Note Purchase Agreement (the “Note Purchase Agreement”), pursuant to which WUP LLC issued $270.0 million aggregate principal amount of equipment notes (collectively, the “Equipment Notes”). The Equipment Notes were issued under separate Trust Indentures and Mortgages (each, an “Indenture” and collectively, the “Indentures”) with respect to each aircraft. The Equipment Notes were issued for net proceeds (before transaction-related expenses) equal to 96% of principal amount, or $259.2 million, and bear interest at the rate of 12% per annum with annual amortization of principal amount equal to 10% per annum.    The Equipment Notes are secured by first-priority liens on 134 of the Company’s owned aircraft fleet and by liens on certain intellectual property assets of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. WUP LLC’s obligations under the Equipment Notes are guaranteed by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries.    Interest and principal payments on the Equipment Notes are payable quarterly on each January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15, beginning on January 15, 2023. The final expected distribution date of the Equipment Notes varies from July 15, 2025 to October 15, 2029 depending on the type of aircraft, unless redeemed earlier by the Company. The Note Purchase Agreement and each Indenture and the related guarantees contain certain operational and financial covenants, including a minimum liquidity covenant and a covenant that limits the maximum loan to value ratio of all aircraft financed, subject to certain cure rights of the Company, and other restrictive covenants that provide limitations under certain circumstances. Each Indenture contains customary events of default for transactions of this type, including cross-default provisions among the Equipment Notes. The maturity of the Equipment Notes may be accelerated upon the occurrence of certain events of default.   20.    RESTATEMENT OF PREVIOUSLY ISSUED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    In connection with the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company’s management identified an error in its previously issued unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. The identified error related to the recognition of a goodwill impairment charge that should have been recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2022.    In connection with these errors, the Company is restating the previously issued unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, and related notes thereto, as of and for the three and six months ended September 30, 2022, as filed in the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q on November 9, 2022.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    The following management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations (“MD&A”) should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q/A and our audited consolidated financial statements included in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. This discussion contains forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. See “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” included in this Form 10-Q/A. Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this MD&A section to “Wheels Up”, “we,” “us,” “our,” and “the Company” are intended to mean the business and operations of Wheels Up Experience Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.Overview of Our Business    Wheels Up strives to disrupt private aviation by delivering innovative, accessible, travel through simple-to-use proprietary technology and mobile applications. We have become a recognized market leader and are redefining private flying by leveraging our unique technology-enabled marketplace platform. We connect flyers to private aircraft, and to one another, creating memorable lifestyle experiences.    We have a diversified and evolving business model generating revenue through flights, membership fees, management of aircraft and other services. Our chief operating decision maker, our chief executive officer, reviews our financial information presented on a consolidated basis, and accordingly, we operate under one reportable segment, which is private aviation services.    Flight revenue includes both retail and wholesale charter. Wheels Up has one of the largest and most diverse mix of available aircraft in the industry. As of September 30, 2022, we have over 200 aircraft in our owned and leased fleet that includes Turboprops, Light, Midsize, Super-Midsize and Large-Cabin jets, approximately half of which are Wheels Up branded aircraft. As of September 30, 2022, we also have a managed fleet across all private aircraft cabin classes of approximately 150 aircraft and an extensive network of third-party operators available in our program fleet from whom we can access over 1,200 additional safety vetted and verified partner aircraft.    Members pay a fixed quoted amount for flights plus certain incidental or additional costs, if applicable. The quoted amount can be based on a contractual capped hourly rate or dynamically priced based on a number of variables at time of booking. Wholesale customers, such as charter flight brokers and third-party operators, primarily pay a fixed rate for flights. Members are also able to pre-purchase amounts of dollar-denominated credits (“Prepaid Blocks”), which can be applied to future costs incurred, including annual dues, flight services, and other incidental costs such as catering and ground transportation. Prepaid Block sales allow us to have a certain amount of revenue visibility into future flight and travel demand. Members who elect not to purchase a Prepaid Block “pay as they fly” by paying for their flights at the time of booking or after their flights.    Membership revenue is generated from initiation and annual renewal fees across three different annual subscription tiers — Connect, Core and Business — each of which is designed to provide the varying services required across a range of existing and potential private flyers. Core membership is ideal for the more frequent individual private flyer who wants guaranteed availability and pricing, high-touch account management, capped rates and values ultimate convenience and flexibility. The Business membership is best suited for companies of any size that want a broader group of individuals in their organization to be able to book and fly, while also requiring maximum flexibility to meet their business needs. Our Business customers include companies that fully-outsource their private travel solution to Wheels Up, including but not necessarily managing their privately owned aircraft, and those that use Wheels Up to serve or supplement their in-house flight desks. We have offered Core and Business memberships with guaranteed aircraft availability and fixed rate pricing since our inception. During 2019, we launched Connect, our introductory membership tier. The Connect membership offers variable rate pricing on a per trip basis and is designed for the consumer with less frequent flight needs or who has more flexibility in their schedule or does not seek capped rate pricing. All membership options provide access through the Wheels Up mobile app to on-demand charter flights, dynamic pricing, a variety of Shared Flights, empty-leg Hot Flights,37Shuttles and The Community, an online platform of members-only forums to facilitate flight sharing, enabling members to reduce their cost of flying private. In addition, customers can qualify for Delta Air Lines, Inc. (“Delta”) miles in the Delta SkyMiles Program as part of their membership.    During 2020, we added a non-membership offering to tap into a larger addressable market and expand flyer participation in our marketplace. Non-member customers now have access to a full-scale marketplace of private aircraft through the Wheels Up mobile app, available on iOS and Android where they can view real-time dynamic pricing for available aircraft classes, making it possible to instantaneously search, book and fly. These flyers are not required to purchase a membership but may pay additional transaction fees not applicable to members and do not receive membership benefits. In addition, non-member flyers do not have aircraft availability guarantees as members do and flights are priced dynamically at rates that are not capped.    We also manage aircraft for owners in exchange for a recurring contractual fee. Under the terms of many of our management agreements, in addition to owners utilizing their own aircraft, the managed aircraft may be used by us to fulfill member and non-member flights on a revenue sharing arrangement with the owner. Revenue associated with the management of aircraft also includes the recovery of owner incurred expenses, as well as recharging of certain incurred aircraft operating costs.    In addition, we earn other revenue from fixed-base operator (“FBO”) and maintenance, repair and overhaul (“MRO”) ground services, flight management software subscriptions, sponsorship and partnership fees, freight, group charter, safety and security, special missions and whole aircraft acquisitions and sales where we act as the broker.Recent Developments    Completion of the Business Combination    On July 13, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), we completed a business combination with Aspirational Consumer Lifestyle Corp., a blank check company originally incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company (the “Business Combination”). We received approximately $656.3 million in gross proceeds in connection with the transaction.    Payoff of Credit Facilities and Promissory Notes    Shortly following the Closing Date, we repaid substantially all of the outstanding principal of our credit facilities and promissory notes, together with all accrued and unpaid interest in the amount of approximately $175.5 million.    Aircraft Purchases    On January 12, 2022, we entered into an agreement with Textron Financial Corporation to exercise our purchase option on 32 leased aircraft. The negotiated purchase price for all aircraft was $65.0 million, and in connection with the purchase we received a reimbursement of approximately $7.3 million for unused maintenance reserves. The sale was completed on February 22, 2022.    Alante Air Charter, LLC Acquisition    On February 3, 2022, we acquired Alante Air Charter, LLC (“Alante Air”), a Scottsdale, Arizona based private jet charter business. The total purchase price for Alante Air was $15.5 million, which was paid in cash. The acquisition added 12 Light jets to our controlled fleet.    Tropic Ocean Investors LLC Investment and Partnership    On March 7, 2022, we made a minority cash investment of $10.0 million in Tropic Ocean Investors LLC (“Tropic Ocean”) and entered into a multiyear commercial cooperation agreement. Tropic Ocean is the world’s largest amphibious airline and leading provider of last-mile private charter and scheduled service in Florida, the Northeastern United States (“U.S.”), the Bahamas, the Caribbean and beyond.38    Air Partner plc Acquisition    On April 1, 2022, we acquired Air Partner plc (“Air Partner”), a United Kingdom-based international aviation services group with operations in 18 locations across four continents. The total purchase price for Air Partner was $108.2 million, which was paid in cash.    Fuel Surcharge and Carbon Offset Fee    On April 9, 2022, we implemented a fixed hourly fuel surcharge ranging from $295 per hour to $895 per hour across our fleet.    On May 2, 2022, we announced we would implement a new fuel surcharge framework effective June 1, 2022. The fuel surcharge is applied when the cost of Jet A fuel, as published by the Argus U.S. Jet Fuel IndexTM., is more than $2.00 per gallon and is calculated based on estimated billable flight time.    In addition, on May 2, 2022, we announced a carbon offset fee will be added to each hour of flight time effective June 1, 2022. The fee ranges from $20 per flight hour to $65 per flight hour.    2022-1 Equipment Note Financing    On October 14, 2022, Wheels Up Partners LLC (“WUP LLC”), an indirect subsidiary of the Company, entered into a Note Purchase Agreement (the “Note Purchase Agreement”), pursuant to which WUP LLC issued $270.0 million aggregate principal amount of equipment notes (collectively, the “Equipment Notes”) using an EETC (enhanced equipment trust certificate) loan structure (the “2022-1 Equipment Note Financing”). The Equipment Notes were issued for net proceeds (before transaction-related expenses) equal to 96% of principal amount and bear interest at the rate of 12% per annum with annual amortization of principal amount equal to 10% per annum. The final expected distribution date of the Equipment Notes varies from July 15, 2025 to October 15, 2029 depending on the type of aircraft, unless redeemed earlier by WUP LLC. The Equipment Notes are secured by first-priority liens on 134 of the Company’s owned aircraft fleet and by liens on certain intellectual property assets of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. WUP LLC’s obligations under the Equipment Notes are guaranteed by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries.    As of September 30, 2022, we had approximately $285.5 million of cash and cash equivalents. On an unaudited pro forma basis, taking into account the net proceeds (before transaction-related expenses) of $259.2 million received by the Company upon consummation of the 2022-1 Equipment Note Financing as if such financing had been completed on September 30, 2022, we would have had approximately $544.7 million of cash and cash equivalents. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for additional information regarding our use non-GAAP financial measures, such as pro forma cash, in this Form 10-Q/A.    Atlanta Member Operations Center    In October 2022, it was announced that we plan to relocate significant elements of our member operations team from Columbus, Ohio to Atlanta, Georgia, which will include construction of a 34,000 square foot Member Operations Center (the “Atlanta Member Operations Center”) and the relocation of certain employees to the Atlanta area. Establishment of the new Atlanta Member Operations Center is expected to centralize our critical functions with the goal of better serving our members and customers. The Company anticipates that the new Atlanta Member Operations Center will be completed and commence operations in mid-2023.Business Impact of COVID-19    For the foreseeable future, we plan to continue the Wheels Up Safe Passage™ program introduced in response to the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic (“COVID-19”). As a result of the increased rate of COVID-19 spread during a portion of the fourth quarter of 2021 and into the first quarter of 2022, flight volumes were negatively impacted, primarily due to a combination of customer cancellations, access to third-party supply and reduced crew availability resulting from COVID-19 exposure. Although flight volumes recovered in the second and third quarters of 2022, we continue to experience supply chain disruptions and increased costs for parts and supplies related to COVID-19.39    Moving forward, we believe the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a shift in consumer prioritization of wellness and safety, with private aviation viewed increasingly by those in the addressable market as a health-conscious decision rather than a discretionary luxury. We believe this will translate into an increase in flight demand over time. We have not had, and do not expect any, material COVID-19 related contingencies, impairments, concessions, credit losses or other expenses in future periods.Non-GAAP Financial Measures    In addition to our results of operations below, we report certain key financial measures that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”).    These non-GAAP financial measures are in addition to, and not a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to any performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures of financial results provide useful supplemental information about Wheels Up to investors and are utilized internally by our management team to assess certain aspects of our performance. However, there are a number of limitations related to the use of these non-GAAP financial measures and their nearest U.S. GAAP equivalents, including that they exclude significant expenses that are required by U.S. GAAP to be recorded in Wheels Up’s financial measures. In addition, other companies may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently or may use other measures to calculate their financial performance, and therefore, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.    Adjusted EBITDA    We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted for (i) interest income (expense), (ii) income tax expense, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) equity-based compensation expense, (v) acquisition and integration related expenses, (vi) public company readiness related expenses, (vii) change in fair value of warrant liability and (viii) other items not indicative of our ongoing operating performance, including but not limited to, restructuring charges. We include Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure for assessing operating performance and for the following:•Use in conjunction with bonus program target achievement determinations, strategic internal planning, annual budgeting, allocating resources and making operating decisions; and•Provides useful information for historical period-to-period comparisons of our business, as it removes the effect of certain non-cash expenses and variable amounts.40    The following table reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, which is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure (in thousands):   Three Months Ended September 30,Nine Months Ended September 30,2022As Restated20212022As Restated2021Net loss$(148,838)$(59,455)$(330,637)$(120,622)Add back (deduct)Interest expense— 782 — 9,503 Interest income(1,130)(7)(1,612)(25)Income tax expense185 — 505 — Other expense, net625 — 1,505 — Depreciation and amortization16,500 13,639 46,862 40,952 Equity-based compensation expense22,504 27,906 65,839 30,668 Public company readiness expense(1)— 2,455 — 3,298 Acquisition and integration expense(2)4,747 644 16,092 5,017 Restructuring charges(3)682 — 6,165 — Change in fair value of warrant liability(2,504)(12,271)(8,265)(12,271)Loss on extinguishment of debt— 2,379 — 2,379 Corporate headquarters relocation expense— — — 31 Impairment of goodwill(4)62,000 — 62,000 — Adjusted EBITDA$(45,229)$(23,928)$(141,546)$(41,070)__________________(1)Includes costs primarily associated with compliance, updated systems and consulting in advance of transitioning to a public company.(2)Consists mainly of system conversions, merging of operating certificates, re-branding costs and fees paid to external advisors in connection with strategic transactions.(3)During 2022, we recorded restructuring charges for employee separation programs following strategic business decisions.(4)Represents a non-cash impairment charge related to goodwill realized in the third quarter of 2022. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.    Adjusted Contribution and Adjusted Contribution Margin    We calculate Adjusted Contribution as gross profit (loss) excluding depreciation and amortization and adjusted further for (i) equity-based compensation included in cost of revenue, (ii) acquisition and integration expense included in cost of revenue and (iii) other items included in cost of revenue that are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance. Adjusted Contribution Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted Contribution by total revenue. We include Adjusted Contribution and Adjusted Contribution Margin as supplemental measures for assessing operating performance and for the following:•To understand our ability to achieve profitability over time through scale and leveraging costs; and•Provides useful information for historical period-to-period comparisons of our business and to identify trends.41    The following table reconciles Adjusted Contribution to gross profit (loss), which is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure (in thousands, except percentages):   Three Months Ended September 30,Nine Months Ended September 30,2022202120222021Revenue$420,356 $301,978 $1,171,503 $849,215 Less: Cost of revenue(403,042)(283,495)(1,144,698)(773,191)Less: Depreciation and amortization(16,500)(13,639)(46,862)(40,952)Gross profit (loss)$814 $4,844 $(20,057)$35,072 Gross margin0.2 %1.6 %(1.7)%4.1 %Add back:Depreciation and amortization$16,500 $13,639 $46,862 $40,952 Equity-based compensation expense in cost of revenue3,581 679 11,320 779 Acquisition and integration expense in cost of revenue650 — 650 1,011 Adjusted Contribution$21,545 $19,162 $38,775 $77,814 Adjusted Contribution Margin5.1 %6.3 %3.3 %9.2 %    Key Operating Metrics    In addition to financial measures, we regularly review certain key operating metrics to evaluate our business, determine the allocation of resources and make decisions regarding business strategies.

We use Active Members42to assess the adoption of our premium offerings which is a key factor in our penetration of the market in which we operate and a key driver of membership and flight revenue.    Active Users    We define Active Users as Active Members and jet card holders as of the reporting date plus unique non-member consumers who completed a revenue generating flight at least once in a given period and excluding wholesale flight activity. While a unique consumer can complete multiple revenue generating flights on our platform in a given period, that unique user is counted as only one Active User. We use Active Users to assess the adoption of our platform and frequency of transactions, which are key factors in our penetration of the market in which we operate and our growth in revenue.    Live Flight Legs    We define Live Flight Legs as the number of completed one-way revenue generating flight legs in a given period. The metric excludes empty repositioning legs and owner legs related to aircraft under management. We believe Live Flight Legs are a useful metric to measure the scale and usage of our platform, and our growth in flight revenue.Component of Results of Our Operations    The key components of our results of operations include:    Revenue    Revenue is derived from flight, membership, aircraft management and other services.    Flight revenue consists of retail and wholesale flights and certain related fees and surcharges. Members can either pay as they fly or prepay for flights when they purchase a Prepaid Block.    Membership revenue is comprised of a one-time initiation fee paid at the commencement of a membership and recurring annual dues. In the first year of membership, a portion of the initiation fee is applied to annual dues. The remainder of the initiation fee, less any flight credits, is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated duration of the customer relationship period, which is estimated to be three years as of September 30, 2022. Members are charged recurring annual dues to maintain their membership. Revenue related to the annual dues are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the related contractual period. If a member qualifies to earn Delta miles in the Delta SkyMiles Program as part of their membership, then a portion of the membership fee is allocated at contract inception.    Aircraft management revenue consists of contractual monthly management fees charged to aircraft owners, recovery of owner incurred expenses including maintenance coordination, cabin crew and pilots, and recharging of certain incurred aircraft operating costs such as maintenance, fuel, landing fees and parking. We pass recovery and recharge amounts back to owners at either cost or at a predetermined margin.    Other revenue primarily consists of (i) ground services derived from aircraft customers that use our FBO and MRO facilities and (ii) flight-related services. In addition, other revenue includes subscription fees from third-party operators for access to our UP FMS software, fees we may receive from third-party sponsorships and partnerships, freight, group charter, safety and security, whole aircraft acquisitions and sales, and special missions including government, defense, emergency and medical transport.    Costs and Expenses    Costs and expenses consist of the following components:    Cost of Revenue    Cost of revenue primarily consists of direct expenses incurred to provide flight services and facilitate operations, including aircraft lease costs, fuel, crew travel, maintenance and third-party flight costs. Cost of revenue43also consists of compensation expenses, including equity-based compensation and related benefits for employees that directly facilitate flight operations. In addition, cost of revenue includes aircraft owner expenses incurred such as maintenance coordination, cabin crew and pilots, and certain aircraft operating costs such as maintenance, fuel, landing fees and parking.    Other Operating Expenses    Technology and Development    Technology and development expense primarily consists of compensation expenses for engineering, product development and design employees, including equity-based compensation, expenses associated with ongoing improvements to, and maintenance of, our platform offerings and other technology. Technology and development expense also includes software expenses and technology consulting fees.    Sales and Marketing    Sales and marketing expense primarily consists of compensation expenses in support of sales and marketing such as commissions, salaries, equity-based compensation and related benefits. Sales and marketing expense also includes expenses associated with advertising, promotions of our services, member experience, account management and brand-building.    General and Administrative    General and administrative expense primarily consists of compensation expenses, including allocable portions of equity-based compensation and related benefits for our executive, finance, human resources and legal teams, and other personnel performing administrative functions. General and administrative expense also includes corporate office rent expense, third-party professional fees, acquisition and integration related expenses, public company readiness expenses and any other cost or expense incurred not deemed to be related to cost of revenue, sales and marketing expense or technology and development expense.    Depreciation and Amortization    Depreciation and amortization expense primarily consists of depreciation of capitalized aircraft. Depreciation and amortization expense also includes amortization of capitalized software development costs and acquired finite-lived intangible assets. We allocate overhead such as facility costs and telecommunications charges, based on department headcount, as we believe this to be the most accurate measure. As a result, a portion of general overhead expenses are reflected in each operating expense category.    Gain on Sale of Aircraft Held for Sale    Gain on sale of aircraft held for sale consists of the gain on aircraft sold where we did not act as a broker. When these aircraft were acquired, it was our intent to sell and not to hold them long-term.    Impairment of Goodwill    Impairment of goodwill consists of any write off of goodwill during the period. Impairment is recorded when the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value as of the impairment assessment date. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.44    Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liability    Change in fair value of warrant liability consists of unrealized gain (loss) on warrants assumed as part of the Business Combination, including Private Warrants and Public Warrants.    Interest Income    Interest income primarily consists of interest earned on cash equivalents in money market funds, U.S. treasury bills and time deposits.    Interest Expense    Interest expense primarily consists of the interest paid or payable and the amortization of debt discounts and deferred financing costs on our credit facilities, promissory notes and other debt obligations.    Income Tax Expense    Income taxes are recorded using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of existing assets and liabilities. These differences are measured using the enacted tax rates that are expected to be in effect when these differences are anticipated to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management believes it is not more likely than not to be realized.45    Results of Our Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2022 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2021    The following table sets forth our results of operations for each of the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands, except percentages):   Three Months Ended September 30,Change in2022As Restated2021$%Revenue$420,356 $301,978 $118,378 39 %Costs and expenses:Cost of revenue403,042 283,495 119,547 42 %Technology and development16,639 8,769 7,870 90 %Sales and marketing30,830 22,157 8,673 39 %General and administrative44,323 42,490 1,833 4 %Depreciation and amortization16,500 13,639 2,861 21 %Gain on sale of aircraft held for sale(1,316)— (1,316)100 %Impairment of goodwill62,000 — 62,000 100 %Total costs and expenses572,018 370,550 201,468 54 %Loss from operations(151,662)(68,572)(83,090)(121)%Other income (expense):Change in fair value of warrant liability2,504 12,271 (9,767)(80)%Loss on extinguishment of debt— (2,379)2,379 (100)%Interest income1,130 7 1,123 100 %Interest expense— (782)782 (100)%Other expense, net(625)— (625)100 %Total other income (expense)3,009 9,117 (6,108)67 %Loss before income taxes(148,653)(59,455)(89,198)(150)%Income tax expense(185)— (185)100 %Net loss(148,838)(59,455)(89,383)(150)%Less: Net loss attributable to non-controlling interests— (970)970 100 %Net loss attributable to Wheels Up Experience Inc.$(148,838)$(58,485)$(90,353)(154)%46    Revenue    Revenue increased by $118.4 million, or 39%, for the three months ended September 30, 2022, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2021. The increase in revenue was primarily attributable to the following changes in membership revenue, flight revenue, aircraft management revenue and other revenue (in thousands, except percentages):   Three Months Ended September 30,Change in20222021$%Membership$22,409 $17,982 $4,427 25 %Flight278,917 218,360 60,557 28 %Aircraft management58,962 58,005 957 2 %Other60,068 7,631 52,437 687 %Total$420,356 $301,978 $118,378 39 %    Growth in membership revenue was driven primarily by a 12% increase in Active Members compared to the three months ended September 30, 2021.    Flight revenue growth was driven by a 7% increase in Live Flight Legs year-over-year, which resulted in $14.5 million of growth, and a 20% increase in flight revenue per Live Flight Leg, which drove $46.0 million of year-over-year improvement. The increase in Live Flight Legs was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of Active Members and the acquisition of Air Partner. Flight revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2022 also includes $16.9 million of fuel surcharge revenue, which we began collecting effective April 1, 2022 and modified to a fuel surcharge indexed to fuel prices effective June 1, 2022. In addition, flight revenue increased due to the acquisition of Air Partner, which added $14.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022.    The increase in aircraft management revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in our recovery of owner and rechargeable costs related to operating aircraft under management, both of which stem from an increase in operating costs.    The increase in other revenue was primarily attributable to a $34.8 million increase in sales of aircraft inventory and the $17.2 million related to the acquisition of Air Partner for the three months ended September 30, 2022.    Cost of Revenue    Cost of revenue increased by $119.5 million, or 42%, for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2021. The increase in cost of revenue is primarily attributable to the increase in flight operating costs due to inflationary pressures, such as increased fuel, maintenance, wages and third-party fulfillment costs, the acquisition of Air Partner and increased whole aircraft sales. In addition, excluding aircraft owner expenses, fuel expense increased by $5.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2021, which was primarily attributable to an increase in fuel prices.    Adjusted Contribution Margin decreased 120 basis points for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2021, which was primarily attributable to cost pressures and supply constraints impacting us and the industry, partially offset by the acquisition of Air Partner and additional whole aircraft sales. Specifically, pilot availability, increased fuel costs, maintenance challenges, wage inflation and increased third-party fulfillment costs each contributed to the decline in Adjusted Contribution Margin. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” above for a definition of Adjusted Contribution Margin, information regarding our use of Adjusted Contribution Margin and a reconciliation of gross margin to Adjusted Contribution Margin.47    Other Operating Expenses    Technology and Development    Technology and development expenses increased by $7.9 million, or 90%, for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2021 which were primarily driven by continued investments in digital transformation including the marketplace platform and UP FMS. The increase in technology and development expenses was primarily attributable to an increase of $4.0 million in employee compensation and allocable costs combined with third-party consultant fees increasing $2.5 million. The increase in employee costs and consultant fees was partially offset by higher capitalized costs related to the development of internal use software of $2.0 million. Additionally, enterprise software expense increased by $2.0 million. Lastly, technology and development expenses increased due to the acquisition of Air Partner, which added $1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022.    Sales and Marketing    Sales and marketing expenses increased by $8.7 million, or 39%, for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2021. The increase in sales and marketing was attributable to an increase of $1.4 million for employee compensation costs and allocable costs. In addition, sales commissions increased $2.4 million driven by higher whole aircraft sales activity. Expenses related to marketing and member benefits declined by $1.4 million year-over-year, of which $0.8 million were related to one-time initial public offering (“IPO”) readiness costs. Lastly, sales and marketing expenses increased due to the acquisition of Air Partner, which added $6.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022.    General and Administrative    General and administrative expenses increased by $1.8 million, or 4%, for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2021. The increase in general and administrative expenses was attributable to an increase of $1.6 million for employee compensation costs and allocable costs, professional service-related fees of $3.0 million, $0.3 million related to public company costs, and $3.5 million in one-time costs related to merger and acquisition activity for the three months ended September 30, 2022. Additionally, general and administrative expenses increased $5.4 million due to the acquisition of Air Partner and Alante Air. These increases were offset by a $1.7 million decrease in one-time IPO readiness costs, a $1.6 million decrease in bad debt expense and a $8.7 million decrease in equity-based compensation.    Depreciation and Amortization    Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by $2.9 million, or 21%, for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2021. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily attributable to a $1.8 million increase in amortization of software development costs. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in amortization of intangible assets of $0.5 million. Lastly, depreciation and amortization expenses increased due to the acquisition of Air Partner, which added $1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022.    Impairment of Goodwill (As Restated)    We recorded non-cash goodwill impairment charges totaling $62.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022, following our interim quantitative goodwill impairment test performed over WUP Legacy as of September 30, 2022 (see Notes 2 and 7 in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included herein).    Interest Income    Interest income increased by $1.1 million, or 100%, for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2021. The increase was attributable to higher rates of interest earned on cash equivalents in money market funds, U.S treasury bills and time deposits.48    Interest Expense    Interest expense decreased by $0.8 million, or 100%, for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2021. The decrease in interest expense was attributable to our repayment of substantially all of the outstanding principal of our long-term debt on July 21, 2021.    Results of Our Operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 Compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021    The following table sets forth our results of operations for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands, except percentages):   Nine Months Ended September 30,Change in2022As Restated2021$%Revenue$1,171,503 $849,215 $322,288 38 %Costs and expenses:Cost of revenue1,144,698 773,191 371,507 48 %Technology and development42,436 23,818 18,618 78 %Sales and marketing87,761 55,846 31,915 57 %General and administrative130,200 76,444 53,756 70 %Depreciation and amortization46,862 40,952 5,910 14 %Gain on sale of aircraft held for sale(3,950)— (3,950)100 %Impairment of goodwill62,000 — 62,000 100 %Total costs and expenses1,510,007 970,251 477,756 49 %Loss from operations(338,504)(121,036)(155,468)(128)%Other income (expense):Change in fair value of warrant liability8,265 12,271 (4,006)100 %Loss on extinguishment of debt— (2,379)2,379 100 %Interest income1,612 25 1,587 100 %Interest expense— (9,503)9,503 (100)%Other expense, net(1,505)— (1,505)100 %Total other income (expense)8,372 414 7,958 (1922)%Loss before income taxes(330,132)(120,622)(209,510)(174)%Income tax expense(505)— (505)100 %Net loss(330,637)(120,622)(210,015)(174)%Less: Net loss attributable to non-controlling interests(387)(6,572)6,185 94 %Net loss attributable to Wheels Up Experience Inc.$(330,250)$(114,050)$(216,200)(190)%49    Revenue    Revenue increased by $322.3 million, or 38%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021.

Additionally, general and administrative expenses increased $10.9 million due to the acquisition of Alante Air and Air Partner for the nine months ended September 30, 2022.    Depreciation and Amortization    Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by $5.9 million, or 14%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily attributable to a $3.9 million increase in amortization of software development costs and a $0.4 million increase in depreciation expense for leasehold improvements. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense for our owned aircraft and amortization of intangible assets of $0.6 million and $1.1 million, respectively. Lastly, depreciation and amortization expenses increased due to the acquisition of Air Partner, which added $3.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022.    Impairment of Goodwill (As Restated)    We recorded non-cash goodwill impairment charges totaling $62.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, following our interim quantitative goodwill impairment test performed over WUP Legacy as of September 30 (see Notes 2 and 7 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein).51    Interest Income    Interest income increased by $1.6 million, or 100%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The increase was attributable to higher rates of interest earned on cash equivalents in money market funds, U.S treasury bills and time deposits.    Interest Expense    Interest expense decreased by $9.5 million, or 100%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The decrease in interest expense was attributable to our repayment of substantially all of the outstanding principal of our long-term debt on July 21, 2021.Liquidity and Capital Resources    Overview    Our principal sources of liquidity have historically consisted of financing activities, including proceeds from the Business Combination and operating activities, primarily from the increase in deferred revenue associated with the sale of Prepaid Blocks. As of September 30, 2022, we had approximately $285.5 million of cash and cash equivalents, which were primarily invested in money market funds, and approximately $26.4 million of restricted cash.    Long-Term Debt    From time to time, we obtain debt financing to, among other things, refinance or purchase aircraft or fund our strategic growth initiatives. Subsequent to September 30, 2022, WUP LLC issued $270.0 million aggregate principal amount Equipment Notes using an EETC (enhanced equipment trust certificate) loan structure. The Equipment Notes were issued for net proceeds (before transaction-related expenses) equal to 96% of principal amount and bear interest at the rate of 12% per annum with annual amortization of principal amount equal to 10% per annum. The final expected distribution date of the Equipment Notes varies from July 15, 2025 to October 15, 2029 depending on the type of aircraft, unless redeemed earlier by WUP LLC. The Equipment Notes are secured by first-priority liens on 134 of the Company’s owned aircraft fleet and by liens on certain intellectual property assets of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. On an unaudited pro forma basis, taking into account the net proceeds (before transaction-related expenses) of $259.2 million received by the Company upon consummation of the 2022-1 Equipment Note Financing as if such financing had been completed on September 30, 2022, we would have had approximately $544.7 million of cash and cash equivalents. We believe our cash and cash equivalents on hand, combined with the net proceeds from the Equipment Notes, will be sufficient to meet our projected working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for additional information regarding our use non-GAAP financial measures, such as pro forma cash, in this Form 10-Q/A.    Cash Flows    The following table summarizes our cash flows for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands):   Nine Months Ended September 30,20222021Net cash used in operating activities$(288,341)$(152,416)Net cash used in investing activities$(171,725)$(8,428)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities$(7,347)$373,398 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash$(7,395)$— Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash$(474,808)$212,554 52    Cash Flow from Operating Activities    Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was $288.3 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the cash outflow from operating activities consisted of our net loss, net of non-cash items of $100.0 million and the balance from an increase in net operating assets and liabilities. In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we sold $658.7 million of Prepaid Blocks compared to $356.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The increase in Prepaid Block purchases was primarily attributable to the growth in Active Members and an out-of-cycle new program and pricing announcement in May 2022.    Cash Flow from Investing Activities    Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was $171.7 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the cash outflow from investing activities was primarily attributable to $98.6 million for capital expenditures, including $18.5 million of software development costs. We also purchased $39.9 million of aircraft held for sale. In addition, we acquired Alante Air and Air Partner for $75.1 million, net of cash acquired. The cash outflow was partially offset by $41.8 million from the sale of aircraft that were classified as held for sale.    Cash Flow from Financing Activities    Net cash used in financing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was $7.3 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the cash outflow from financing activities was attributable to a payment for shares that were withheld to settle employee taxes due upon the vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units.Contractual Obligations and Commitments    As of September 30, 2022, our principal commitments consisted of contractual cash obligations under our operating leases for certain controlled aircraft, corporate headquarters, and operational facilities, including aircraft hangars. For further information on our leases, see Note 12, Leases of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.    Long-Term Debt    On October 14, 2022, WUP LLC issued $270.0 million aggregate principal amount Equipment Notes using an EETC (enhanced equipment trust certificate) loan structure. The Equipment Notes were issued for net proceeds (before transaction-related expenses) equal to 96% of principal amount and bear interest at the rate of 12% per annum with annual amortization of principal amount equal to 10% per annum. The final expected distribution date of the Equipment Notes varies from July 15, 2025 to October 15, 2029 depending on the type of aircraft, unless redeemed earlier by WUP LLC. The Equipment Notes are secured by first-priority liens on 134 of the Company’s owned aircraft fleet and by liens on certain intellectual property assets of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. WUP LLC’s obligations under the Equipment Notes are guaranteed by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. The Equipment Notes and related documents contain certain restrictive covenants, including a minimum liquidity covenant and a covenant that limits the maximum loan to value ratio of all aircraft financed, and customary events of default for transactions of this type, including cross-default provisions among the Equipment Notes.    For further information on the 2022-1 Equipment Note Financing, see Note 19, Subsequent Events of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. For further information about our long-term debt and lease obligations, see Note 10, Long-term Debt and Note 12, Leases, respectively, of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.53Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates    For further information on our critical accounting policies and estimates, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.Recent Accounting Pronouncements    For further information on recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.   ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK    Except for the material changes set forth below, there has not been any material change to the information included in Part II, Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.    In the ordinary course of operating our business, we are exposed to market risks. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position or results of operations due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our principal market risks have related to interest rates, aircraft fuel, inflation and foreign currency exchange.    Aircraft Fuel    We are subject to market risk associated with changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel. Aircraft fuel expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 represented 13% and 15% of our total cost of revenue and includes the recharge of fuel costs to our aircraft management customers. Based on our fuel consumption during the nine months ended September 30, 2022, a hypothetical 10% increase in the average price per gallon of aircraft fuel would have increased fuel expense by approximately $5.3 million and $16.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively. We do not purchase or hold any derivative instruments to protect against the effects of changes in fuel, but due to our dynamic pricing we do have the ability to raise our prices on those flights priced that way. In addition, our agreements allow us to bill members a fuel price surcharge and we exercised our right to apply this surcharge to our hourly rate for the first time on April 9, 2022. Subsequently, on May 2, 2022, we announced a new fuel surcharge framework. Beginning on June 1, 2022, we calculated and billed the fuel surcharge based on the cost of Jet A fuel, which limits our direct exposure to volatility in Jet A fuel prices to the extent the fuel surcharge applies. See “Recent Developments” above for further information regarding the details of the fuel surcharge.    Foreign Currency Exchange    We are subject to foreign currency exchange risk primarily through Air Partner’s international operations, which involve revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies. To manage foreign currency exchange risk, we execute international revenue and expense transactions in the same foreign currency to the extent practicable. As of September 30, 2022, we did not hold any derivative instruments to protect against the risk of foreign currency fluctuations.                  54   ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES    Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q/A.    At the time of the Original 10-Q Filing, management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, initially concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2022. As a result of the restatement of the Company’s financial statements and the material weakness identified below, management has reconsidered its assessment and now concludes that we did not maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures.    Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting    In connection with the preparation of the audited financial statements to be included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K, management identified a material weakness in certain internal controls over financial reporting related to the financial statement close process. The deficiency resulted in a restatement of the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 to recognize a non-cash goodwill impairment charge which should have been recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2022, which resulted in the understatement of Net loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. The Company filed a Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A with the SEC on March 31, 2023 to restate the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. The Company’s remediation plan will be described in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.    Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting    As we integrate our business and optimize processes, we continue to convert our business to a single instance of Netsuite and our Flight Management System to UP FMS. We are employing a phased implementation approach that will provide continued monitoring and assessment to maintain the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting during and after the conversions. The conversions were not in response to any identified significant deficiency or material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting.    On April 1, 2022, we acquired all of the outstanding equity of Air Partner plc. We are in the process of analyzing, evaluating and where necessary, implementing changes in controls and procedures. As a result, the process may result in additions or changes to our internal control over financial reporting.    Except as described above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2022, which were identified in connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rule 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.      55   PART II. OTHER INFORMATIONITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS    From time to time, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted, which arise in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the outcome of any of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.   Item 1A. RISK FACTORS    In addition to the risks set forth below and the information set forth in this Form 10-Q/A, you should carefully consider the “Risk Factors” included under Item 1A. to Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. You should be aware that these risk factors and other information may not describe every risk facing Wheels Up. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.    Because our software could be used to collect and store personal information, privacy concerns in the territories in which we operate could result in additional costs and liabilities to us or inhibit sales of our software offering.    The regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. Many government bodies and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations regarding the collection, use, storage and disclosure of personal information and breach notification procedures. We are also required to comply with laws, rules and regulations relating to data security. Interpretation of these laws, rules and regulations and their application to our software and professional services in applicable jurisdictions is ongoing and cannot be fully determined at this time.    In the U.S., these include rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the Federal Trade Commission, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) and other state and federal laws relating to privacy and data security. By way of example, the CCPA requires covered businesses to provide new disclosures to California residents, provide them new ways to opt-out of certain disclosures of personal information, and allows for a new cause of action for data breaches. It includes a framework that includes potential statutory damages and private rights of action. There is some uncertainty as to how the CCPA, and similar privacy laws emerging in other states, could impact our business as it depends on how such laws will be interpreted. As we expand our operations, compliance with privacy laws may increase our operating costs.    Outside the U.S., an increasing number of laws, regulations, and industry standards apply to data privacy and security. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), took effect in the European Union (“EU”) on May 25, 2018. Notwithstanding the withdrawal of the United Kingdom (“UK”), from the EU, by operation of the so-called UK GDPR, the GDPR continues to apply in substantially equivalent form, so when we refer to the GDPR, we are also making reference to the UK GDPR in the context of the UK, unless the context requires otherwise. The GDPR increased covered businesses’ data privacy and security obligations and imposed stringent data privacy and security requirements, including, for example, detailed notices about how such businesses process personal data, the implementation of security measures, mandatory security breach notification requirements, contractual data protection requirements on data processors and limitations on the retention of records of personal data processing activities.    Such restrictions could increase our exposure to regulatory enforcement action, increase our compliance costs, and adversely affect our business.    Our obligations in connection with our contractual obligations, including long-term leases and debt financing obligations, could impair our liquidity and thereby harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.    We have significant long-term lease and debt financing obligations primarily relating to our aircraft fleet, and we may incur additional obligations as we expand our aircraft fleet and operations. As of September 30, 2022, we had 68 aircraft under operating leases, with an average remaining lease term of approximately 4.1 years. As of September 30, 2022, future minimum lease payments due under all long-term operating leases were approximately $154.8 million. In addition, on October 14, 2022, Wheels Up Partners LLC (“WUP LLC”), an indirect subsidiary of the Company, issued equipment notes56(collectively, the “Equipment Notes”) in an aggregate principal amount of $270.0 million (the “2022-1 Equipment Note Financing”) secured by 134 of the Company’s owned aircraft fleet and certain of our intellectual property assets of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. The Equipment Notes require quarterly payments of interest and a specified percentage of unpaid principal amount, and have final expected distribution dates ranging from July 15, 2025 to October 15, 2029 depending on the type of aircraft, unless earlier redeemed by WUP LLC.    Our ability to timely pay our contractual obligations, including our long-term lease obligations and required payments under the Equipment Notes, will depend on our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity and ability to secure additional financing, which will in turn depend on, among other things, the success of our current business strategy, U.S. and global economic and political conditions, the availability and cost of financing, and other factors that may be beyond our control. If our liquidity is materially diminished, our cash flow available to fund our working capital requirements, debt service obligations, capital expenditures and strategic initiatives may be materially and adversely affected, or we may not be able to realize the benefits of, or otherwise maintain, certain relationships with our business partners. We cannot be assured that our operations will generate sufficient cash flow to make any required payments, or that we will be able to obtain financing to make expenditures in pursuit of our strategic initiatives. The amount of our contractual obligations and timing of required payments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.    Our ability to obtain additional financing on terms we deem attractive or access the capital markets may be limited under certain circumstances.    Our operations are capital intensive, and we require sufficient liquidity levels for our operations and strategic growth plans. We have significant debt obligations and may seek to incur additional indebtedness in the future to fund working capital requirements, debt service obligations, capital expenditures and strategic initiatives. Numerous factors may affect our ability to obtain financing or access the capital markets in the future on terms attractive to us, including our liquidity, operating cash flows and the timing of capital requirements, credit status and any credit ratings assigned to us, market conditions in the private aviation industry, U.S. and global economic conditions and conditions in the capital markets generally, and the availability of our assets as collateral for future financings. We can provide no assurance that external financing will be available to us in the future on terms that we deem attractive, or at all, to fund the capital needs for our business. If we are unable to source additional financing on terms we deem attractive, or at all, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected, and we may be unable to execute our strategic goals.    Agreements governing our debt obligations include financial and other covenants that provide limitations on our business and operations under certain circumstances, and failure to comply with any of the covenants in such agreements could adversely impact us.    Our financing agreements, including those in connection with the 2022-1 Equipment Note Financing, and other financing agreements that we may enter into from time to time, contain certain affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and other customary events of default. Under certain circumstances, such covenants require us to maintain minimum liquidity levels, limit our ability to enter into certain strategic transactions, make certain investments, pay dividends and make certain other specified restricted payments, and limit the loan-to-value ratio of all aircraft financed under the Equipment Notes based on periodic appraisals of aircraft. Certain covenants in our financing agreements are subject to important exceptions, qualifications and cure rights, including, under limited circumstances, the requirement to provide additional collateral or prepay or redeem certain obligations. In addition, certain of our financing agreements are cross-collateralized, such that an event of default or acceleration of indebtedness under one agreement could result in an event of default under other financing agreements. If we fail to comply with such covenants, if any other events of default occur for which no waiver or amendment is obtained, or if we are unable to timely refinance the debt obligations subject to such covenants or take other mitigating actions, the holders of our indebtedness could, among other things, declare outstanding amounts immediately due and payable and, subject to the terms of relevant financing agreements, repossess or foreclose on collateral, including certain of our aircraft or other assets used in our business. The acceleration of significant indebtedness or actions to repossess or foreclose on collateral may cause us to renegotiate, repay or refinance the affected obligations, and there is no assurance that such efforts would be successful or on terms we deem attractive. In addition, any acceleration or actions to repossess or foreclose on collateral under our financing agreements could result in a downgrade of any credit ratings then applicable to us, which could result in additional events of default or limit our ability to obtain additional financing.      57    We may not be able to successfully implement our strategies to improve operational efficiency.    We have started to implement and will continue to implement certain strategies to improve the efficiency of our operations. These efficiency improvements include, among other things, consolidation of our FAA certificates and our recently announced plan to relocate significant elements of our member operations team to Atlanta, Georgia (the “Relocation”). In connection with the Relocation, we will build a new member operations center in Atlanta, centralizing our critical functions with the goal of better serving our members and customers.    We face numerous challenges in implementing our strategies to improve operational efficiency, including additional expense to implement such strategies, cooperation from third parties, such as regulatory bodies, which may be outside of our control, and additional time and attention from management, which could distract them from focusing on our growth strategies and day-to-day business activities. For example, there are a number of risks associated with the Relocation, including the following:•we may not effectively transition our workforce as part of the Relocation, in which case we could experience business disruption as a result of a loss of historical knowledge and a lack of business continuity;•we may experience increased turnover and challenges in recruiting additional employees and retaining existing employees and we may be unable to recruit employees with the requisite skills to work at our future member operations center;•we may not complete the Relocation during the expected timeframe; and•we may incur capital expenditures for the Relocation in excess of our expected capital expenditures.    Although we may devote significant financial and other resources to implementing our strategies to improve operational efficiency, these efforts may not be successful or achieve the desired results. Our inability to successfully implement our operational efficiency improvement strategies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and any assumptions underlying estimates of expected cost savings or expected revenues may be inaccurate.58   ITEM 2.
