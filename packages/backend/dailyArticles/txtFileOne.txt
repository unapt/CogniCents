NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(unaudited)
1.�CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
     The Consolidated Statements of Operations and the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss for the three and nine months ended February�28, 2023 and 2022, the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of February�28, 2023, the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the nine months ended February�28, 2023 and 2022, and the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders� Equity for the nine months ended February�28, 2023 and 2022 have been prepared by the Company and are unaudited. The Consolidated Balance Sheet as of May�31, 2022 was derived from audited consolidated financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) necessary to state fairly the financial position, changes in stockholders� equity and comprehensive income, results of operations and cash flows as of and for the period ended February�28, 2023 (and for all periods presented) have been made.
     The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended February�28, 2023 and 2022 include the accounts of AngioDynamics, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company", "we", "our" or "us"). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
2.�ACQUISITIONS
Camaro Support Catheter Asset Acquisition
     On July 27, 2021, the Company acquired the Camaro support catheter (rebranded as Syntrax) from QX Medical, LLC for an aggregate purchase price of $4.0�million, which included an upfront payment of $3.6�million and $0.4�million in purchase price holdbacks, along with $1.0�million of potential future contingent consideration related to revenue milestones. This acquisition supports the Auryon product family and the Company's strategic plan. The Company accounted for this acquisition as an asset purchase. The Company recorded the amount paid at closing as inventory and fixed assets of $0.1�million and an intangible asset product technology of $3.9�million. The intangible asset will be amortized over�15�years. The contingent consideration is comprised of revenue milestones and will be accounted for when the contingency is resolved or becomes probable and reasonably estimable.
3.�REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS
Revenue Recognition
     Under ASC 606,�Revenue from Contracts with Customers, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of ASC 606, the Company performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
     The Company has one primary revenue stream which is the sales of its products.
Disaggregation of Revenue
     As the Company has previously announced, the Company is focused on its ongoing transformation from a company with a broad portfolio of largely undifferentiated products to a more focused medical technology company that delivers unique and innovative health care solutions. The Company believes that this transformation will enable the Company to shift the portfolio from the mature, lower-growth markets where we have competed in the past by investing in technology and products that provide access to larger and faster growing markets. As such, we believe the growth in the near to mid-term will be driven by our Med Tech segment.
     The following table summarizes net sales by Med Tech, Med Device and by geography:

Net Product Revenue
     The Company's products consist of a wide range of medical, surgical and diagnostic devices used by professional healthcare providers for vascular access, for the treatment of peripheral vascular disease and for use in oncology and surgical settings. The Company's products are generally used in minimally invasive, image-guided procedures. Most of the Company's products are intended to be used once and then discarded, or they may be implanted for short or long term use. The Company sells its products to its distributors and to end users, such as interventional radiologists, interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons, urologists, interventional and surgical oncologists and critical care nurses.
Contracts and Performance Obligations
     The Company contracts with its customers based on customer purchase orders, which in many cases are governed by master purchasing agreements. The Company�s contracts with customers are generally for product only, and do not include other performance obligations such as services or other material rights. As part of its assessment of each contract, the Company evaluates certain factors including the customer�s ability to pay (or credit risk). For each contract, the Company considers the promise to transfer products, each of which is distinct, to be the identified performance obligations.
Transaction Price and Allocation to Performance Obligations
     Transaction prices of products are typically based on contracted rates. Product revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring products to a customer, net of any variable consideration as described below.
     If a contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised products underlying each performance obligation. The Company has standard pricing for its products and determines standalone selling prices based on the price at which the performance obligation is sold separately.
Revenue Recognition
     Revenue is recognized when control of the product is transferred to the customer (i.e., when the Company�s performance obligation is satisfied), which occurs at a point in time, and may be upon shipment from the Company�s manufacturing site or delivery to the customer�s named location, based on the shipping terms of a contract.
     In determining whether control has transferred, the Company considers if there is a present right to payment from the customer and when physical possession, legal title and risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer.
     The Company typically invoices customers upon satisfaction of identified performance obligations. As the Company�s standard payment terms are�30�to�90�days from invoicing, the Company does not provide any significant financing to its customers.
     The Company enters into agreements to place placement and evaluation units (�units�) at customer sites, but the Company retains title to the units. For the duration of these agreements the customer has the right to use the unit at no upfront charge in connection with the customer�s ongoing purchase of disposables. These types of agreements include an embedded operating lease for the right to use the units. In these arrangements, revenue recognized for the sale of the disposables is not allocated

between the disposal revenue and lease revenue due to the insignificant value of the units in relation to the total agreement value.
    Sales, value add, and other taxes collected on behalf of third parties are excluded from revenue.
Variable Consideration
     Reserves: Revenue from product sales are recorded at the net sales price (transaction price), which includes estimates of variable consideration for which reserves are established for discounts, returns, rebates and allowances that are offered within contracts between the Company and its customers. These reserves are based on the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are classified as a contra asset.
     Rebates and Allowances: The Company provides certain customers with rebates and allowances that are explicitly stated in the Company�s contracts and are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the period the related product revenue is recognized. The Company establishes reserves for such amounts, which is included in accrued expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. These rebates and allowances result from performance-based offers that are primarily based on attaining contractually specified sales volumes. The Company is also required to pay administrative fees to group purchasing organizations.
     Product Returns: The Company generally offers customers a limited right of return. Product returns after�30�days must be pre-approved by the Company and customers may be subject to a�20% restocking charge. To be accepted, a returned product must be unadulterated, undamaged and have at least�twelve months�remaining prior to its expiration date. The Company estimates the amount of its product sales that may be returned by its customers and records this estimate as a reduction of revenue in the period the related product revenue is recognized. The Company currently estimates product return liabilities using its historical product return information and considers other factors that it believes could significantly impact its expected returns, including product recalls.�During the nine months ended February�28, 2023, such product returns were not material.
Contract Balances with Customers
     A receivable is generally recognized in the period the Company ships the product. Payment terms on invoiced amounts are based on contractual terms with each customer and generally coincide with revenue recognition. Accordingly, the Company does not have any contract assets associated with the future right to invoice its customers. In some cases, if control of the product has not yet transferred to the customer or the timing of the payments made by the customer precedes the Company�s fulfillment of the performance obligation, the Company recognizes a contract liability that is included in deferred revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Costs to Obtain or Fulfill a Customer Contract
     Under ASC 606, the Company may recognize an asset for incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if it expects to recover those costs. The Company�s sales incentive compensation plans qualify for capitalization since these plans are directly related to sales achieved during a period of time. However, the Company has elected the practical expedient under ASC 340-40-25-4 to expense the costs as they are incurred within selling and marketing expenses since the amortization period is less than one year.
     The Company accounts for shipping and handling activities related to contracts with customers as costs to fulfill the promise to transfer the associated products. Shipping and handling costs, associated with the distribution of finished products to customers, are recorded in costs of goods sold and are recognized when the related finished product is shipped to the customer. Amounts charged to customers for shipping and handling are recorded in net sales.

     The Company periodically reviews inventory for both obsolescence and loss of value. The Company makes assumptions about the future demand for and market value of the inventory. Based on these assumptions, the Company estimates the amount of obsolete, expiring and slow-moving inventory. The total inventory reserve at February�28, 2023 and May�31, 2022 was $3.1�million and $3.7�million, respectively.
   
5.�GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Goodwill
     Goodwill is not amortized, but rather, is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination.
     The Company has historically performed its annual goodwill assessment during the third quarter of each fiscal year. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, the Company changed its annual impairment assessment date from December 31 to April 30 to more closely align the impairment assessment date with the Company's long term planning and forecasting process.
     The Company's annual testing for impairment of goodwill was completed as of April 30, 2022. Prior to the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, the Company managed its operations as�one�reporting unit. At the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, the Company began to manage its operations as�two�operating segments and�two�reporting units, namely Med Tech and Med Device (see Note 11 "Segment and Geographic Information" set forth in the Notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q). As a result of this change, goodwill was required to be allocated to each reporting unit and an interim goodwill impairment assessment was performed at the Company and reporting unit levels. To determine the fair value of the individual reporting units and the entire company as of June 1, 2022, the Company utilized the income approach. The income approach is based on the projected cash flows discounted to their present value using discount rates, that in the Company's judgment, consider the timing and risk of the forecasted cash flows using internally developed forecasts and assumptions. Under the income approach, the discount rate used is the average estimated value of a market participant�s cost of capital and debt, derived using customary market metrics. Other significant assumptions include revenue growth rates, profitability projections, and terminal value growth rates. The market approach was also considered; however, the income approach was chosen as the Company determined it is a better representation of both the Med Tech and Med Device reporting units' projected long-term performance. The fair value of each reporting unit and the Company as a whole was assessed to determine if there was any impairment. The Company compared each reporting unit's fair value to the adjusted carrying value to conclude that there was no impairment for either reporting unit or the Company as a whole. The adjusted carrying value of each reporting unit was used to calculate the Company's book value to compare to its market capitalization at the assessment date. Based on the results of this evaluation, there were no adjustments to goodwill for either reporting unit or the Company as a whole as of August 31, 2022.

     There were no adjustments to goodwill for the nine months ended February�28, 2023 other than foreign currency translation adjustments.
     Even though the Company determined that there was�no�goodwill impairment at February�28, 2023, the future occurrence of a potential indicator of impairment, such as a significant adverse change in legal, regulatory, business or economic conditions or a more-likely-than-not expectation that one of the reporting units or a significant portion of either of the reporting units will be sold or disposed of, would require an interim assessment for the reporting units prior to the next required annual assessment as of April 30, 2023.
Definite Lived Intangible Assets
     Intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis. Useful lives range from�two�to�eighteen years. The Company periodically reviews, and adjusts, if necessary, the estimated useful lives of its intangible assets and reviews such assets or asset groups for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or asset groups may not be recoverable. If an intangible asset or asset group is considered to be impaired, the amount of the impairment will equal the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset.

7.�LONG-TERM DEBT
     On August 30, 2022, the Company repaid all amounts outstanding under its then existing credit agreement and entered into a new Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with its lenders, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, sole bookrunner, and sole lead arranger, and Bank of America, N.A. and KeyBank National Association, as Syndication Agents.
     The Credit Agreement provides for a $75.0�million secured revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Facility") and a $30.0�million delayed draw term loan (the "Delayed Draw Term Loan"), and also includes an uncommitted expansion feature that allows the Company to increase the total revolving commitments and/or add new tranches of term loans in an aggregate amount not to exceed $75.0�million.� Each exercise of such expansion feature must be drawn in $5.0�million increments. The proceeds of the Revolving Facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions. The proceeds of the Delayed Draw Term Loan may be used for general corporate purposes, including primarily to finance the manufacturing costs of the Auryon laser capital equipment.
     The Credit Agreement has a�five-year�maturity. Interest on the Revolving Facility and Delayed Draw Term Loan will be based, at the Company's option, on a rate equal to (i) the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") plus�0.10% (subject to a floor of�0%), or (ii) if the Company elects to treat a borrowing as an ABR Borrowing, an alternate base rate based on SOFR, plus, in each case, an applicable margin of�1.25%,�1.50% or�1.75%, depending on the leverage ratio. If any amounts are not paid when due, such overdue amounts will bear interest at an amount generally equal to�2.0% plus the existing loan rate. The Credit Agreement also carries a commitment fee in the case of the Revolving Facility, and a ticking fee, in the case of the Delayed Draw Term Loans of�0.20% to�0.25% per annum on the unused portion.
     The Company's obligations under the Credit Agreement are unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by the Company's material direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries (the �Guarantors�). All obligations of the Company and the Guarantors under the Credit Agreement are secured by first priority security interests in substantially all of the assets of the Company and the Guarantors.
     The Credit Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants, and acceleration, indemnity and events of default provisions, including, among other things,�two�quarterly financial covenants as follows:�
�Maximum leverage ratio of consolidated total indebtedness* to consolidated EBITDA* of not greater than�3.00�to 1.00 (during certain periods following material acquisitions the ratio shall be increased to�3.50�to 1.00).
14

Table of Contents
�Fixed charge coverage ratio of consolidated EBITDA minus consolidated capital expenditures* to�consolidated interest expense* paid or payable in cash plus scheduled principal payments in respect of indebtedness under the Credit Agreement of not less than�1.25�to 1.00.
* The definitions of consolidated total indebtedness, consolidated EBITDA, consolidated capital expenditures and consolidated interest expense are specifically defined in the Credit Agreement included as an exhibit to Form 8-K filed on August 31, 2022.
     As of February�28, 2023, there was $25.0�million outstanding on the Revolving Facility and $25.0�million outstanding on the Delayed Draw Term Loan and the interest rate at February�28, 2023 applicable to each was�6.15%. As of February�28, 2023 and May�31, 2022, the carrying value of long-term debt approximated its fair market value.

     Principal payments of approximately�3.57% on the Delayed Draw Term Loan will amortize in equal quarterly installments over a�five year�period beginning on the earlier of a full draw or the expiry of the draw period (March 1, 2024).
   
8.�INCOME TAXES
     The Company provides for income taxes at the end of each interim period based on the estimated effective tax rate for the full fiscal year adjusted for any discrete events, which are recorded in the period that they occur. �The estimated annual effective tax rate prior to discrete items was�5.2% as of the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, as compared to�12.7% for the same period in fiscal year 2022. In fiscal year 2023, the Company�s effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to the impact of the valuation allowance, foreign taxes, and other non-deductible permanent items (such as non-deductible meals and entertainment, Section 162(m) excess compensation and non-deductible share-based compensation).
     The Company regularly assesses its ability to realize its deferred tax assets. Assessing the realization of deferred tax assets requires significant management judgment. In determining whether its deferred tax assets are more likely than not realizable, the Company evaluated all available positive and negative evidence, and weighted the evidence based on its objectivity.
     Based on the review of all available evidence, the Company determined that it has not yet attained a sustained level of profitability and the objectively verifiable negative evidence outweighed the positive evidence. Therefore, the Company has provided a valuation allowance on its federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, federal and state R&D credit carryforwards and other net deferred tax assets that have a limited life and are not supportable by the naked credit deferred tax liability sourced income as of February�28, 2023. The Company will continue to assess the level of the valuation allowance required. If sufficient positive evidence exists in future periods to support a release of some or all of the valuation allowance, such a release would likely have a material impact on the Company�s results of operations.
   
9.�SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION
     On October 13, 2020, the Company's shareholders approved the 2020 Stock and Incentive Award Plan (the �2020 Plan�). The 2020 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance share units, performance shares and other incentive awards to the Company's employees, directors and other service providers. On November 3, 2022 the Company's shareholders approved an amendment to the 2020 Plan to increase the reserve of shares of common stock available for future grants by�1,950,000�shares. As of February�28, 2023, there was a maximum of�2.9�million shares of common stock available for future grant under the 2020 Plan.
     Prior to the adoption of the 2020 Plan, equity awards were issued under the 2004 Stock and Incentive Award Plan (the �2004 Plan�). The adoption of the 2020 Plan did not impact the administration of equity awards issued under the 2004 Plan but following the adoption of the 2020 Plan, equity award grants are no longer made under the 2004 Plan.
     The Company also has an employee stock purchase plan. On November 3, 2022 the Company's shareholders approved an amendment to the employee stock purchase plan to increase the reserve of shares of common stock available for future grants by�1,000,000�shares. As of February�28, 2023, there was a maximum of�3.2�million shares of common stock available for future grant under the employee stock purchase plan.

Table of Contents
     For the three months ended February�28, 2023 and 2022, share-based compensation expense was $1.8�million and $2.4�million, respectively. For the nine months ended February�28, 2023 and 2022, share-based compensation expense was $8.2�million and $7.8�million, respectively.
     During the nine months ended February�28, 2023 and 2022, the Company granted stock options and restricted stock units under the 2020 Plan to certain employees and members of the Board of Directors. Stock option awards are valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. Restricted stock unit awards are valued based on the closing trading value of the Company�s common stock on the date of grant and then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award.
     During the nine months ended February�28, 2023 and 2022, the Company granted performance share units under the 2020 Plan to certain employees. The awards may be earned by achieving performance levels over the requisite service period. The performance criteria are based on achieving certain performance targets and the total shareholder return (�TSR�) of the Company�s common stock relative to the TSR of the common stock of a pre-defined industry peer-group. The fair value of these awards is based on a Monte Carlo simulation model.
     As of February�28, 2023, there was $17.6�million of unrecognized compensation expense related to share-based payment arrangements. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately�three years. The Company has sufficient shares to satisfy expected share-based payment arrangements.
10.�EARNINGS PER SHARE
     Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding without consideration of potential common stock. Diluted earnings per share includes the dilutive effect of potential common stock consisting of stock options, restricted stock units and performance stock units, provided that the inclusion of such securities is not anti-dilutive. In periods with a net loss, stock options and restricted stock units are not included in the computation of diluted loss per share as the impact would be anti-dilutive.

Segment information
    The Company regularly reviews its segments and the approach used by the chief operating decision maker, the President and Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"), and management to evaluate performance and allocate resources. Prior to the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, the Company considered the business to be a single operating segment engaged in the development, manufacture and sale of medical devices for vascular access, peripheral vascular disease and oncology on a global basis. Commencing with the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, the Company began to manage its operations through�two�segments, Med Tech and Med Device to align with the transformation from a company with a broad portfolio of largely undifferentiated products to a more focused medical technology company. The CEO evaluates these�two�segments based on net sales and gross margin to, among other items, allocate resources and assess performance. Executives reporting to the CEO include those responsible for commercial operations, manufacturing operations, regulatory and quality and certain corporate functions. The CEO evaluates all other elements of profitability, investment and cash flow metrics on a consolidated global basis due to shared infrastructure and resources.
     The Company manages its assets on a total company basis, not by operating segment; therefore, the CEO does not review any asset information by operating segment and, accordingly, asset information is not reported or evaluated by operating segment. Total assets were $542.8�million as of February�28, 2023.
     The table below summarizes net sales and gross margin by Med Tech and Med Device including prior periods during which the Company considered the business to be a single operating segment, in order to conform to the current period presentation:

     For the three months ended February�28, 2023 and 2022, international sales as a percentage of total net sales were�16.2% and�15.6%, respectively. For the nine months ended February�28, 2023 and 2022, international sales as a percentage of total net sales were�15.9% and�16.1%, respectively. Sales to any one country outside the U.S., as determined by shipment destination, did not comprise a material portion of net sales in any of the last three fiscal years. In addition, no one customer represents more than 10% of consolidated net sales and�85% of long-lived assets are located within the United States.
    
12.�FAIR VALUE
     On a recurring basis, the Company measures certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value based upon quoted market prices, where available. Where quoted market prices or other observable inputs are not available, the Company applies valuation techniques to estimate fair value. FASB ASC Topic 820,�Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,�establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements. The categorization of financial assets and financial liabilities within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement of fair value. The three levels of the hierarchy are defined as follows:
�Level 1 - Inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities.
�Level 2 - Inputs to the valuation methodology are other observable inputs, including quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities and market-corroborated inputs.
�Level 3 - Inputs to the valuation methodology are significant unobservable inputs based on management�s best estimate of inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date, including assumptions about risk.
     The Company's financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and contingent consideration. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximates fair value due to their immediate or short-term maturities. The recurring fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) relate to contingent consideration liabilities.

     Contingent Liability for Acquisition Earn Outs
     Some of the Company's business combinations involve the potential for the payment of future contingent consideration upon the achievement of certain product development milestones or various other performance conditions. Payment of the additional consideration is generally contingent on the acquired company reaching certain performance milestones, including attaining specified revenue levels or product development targets. Contingent consideration is recorded at the estimated fair value of the contingent payments on the acquisition date. The fair value of the contingent consideration is remeasured at the estimated fair value at each reporting period with the change in fair value recognized as income or expense within change in fair value of contingent consideration in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
     The Company measures the initial liability and remeasures the liability on a recurring basis using Level 3 inputs as defined under authoritative guidance for fair value measurements, which is determined using a discounted cash flow model applied to projected net sales, using probabilities of achieving projected net sales and projected payment dates. Projected net

sales are based on internal projections and extensive analysis of the target market and the sales potential. Increases or decreases in any valuation inputs in isolation may result in a significantly lower or higher fair value measurement in the future.

     At February�28, 2023, the amount of undiscounted future contingent consideration that the Company expects to pay as a result of all completed acquisitions is approximately $20.0�million. The milestones, including revenue projections and technical milestones associated with the contingent consideration, must be reached in future periods ranging from fiscal years 2023 to 2029 in order for the associated consideration to be paid.
   
13.�LEASES
     The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception of the contract. The Company has operating leases for buildings, primarily for office space, R&D, manufacturing and warehousing.
     Operating lease right-of-use (�ROU�) assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. Many of the lease agreements contain renewal or termination clauses that are factored into the determination of the lease term if it is reasonably certain that these options would be exercised. The Company recognizes lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
     The following table presents supplemental balance sheet information related to leases:

     The interest rate implicit in lease agreements is typically not readily determinable, and as such the Company used the incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of future payments. The incremental borrowing rate is defined as the interest the Company would pay to borrow on a collateralized basis, considering factors such as length of lease term.�The following table presents the weighted average remaining lease term and discount rate:

14.�COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

     The Company is involved in various legal proceedings, including commercial, intellectual property, product liability, and regulatory matters of a nature considered normal for its business. The Company accrues for amounts related to these matters if it is probable that a liability has been incurred, and an amount can be reasonably estimated. The Company discloses such matters when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a material loss may have been incurred. However, the Company cannot predict the outcome of any litigation or the potential for future litigation.
   
C.R. Bard, Inc. v. AngioDynamics, Inc.

     On January 11, 2012, C.R. Bard, Inc. (�Bard�) filed a suit in the United States District Court of Utah claiming certain of the Company's implantable port products infringe on�three�U.S. patents held by Bard (US Patent Nos. 7,785,302 ("302"), 7,959,615 (�615�) and 7,947,022 ("022")). The case was stayed pending reexamination in the US Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO"). Following the reexamination proceedings, and the parties� related appeals to the Federal Circuit which resulted in further proceedings at the USPTO, certain claims of the 615 patent were held invalid, while the remaining claims of the 615 patent and the other�two�patents were upheld over the prior art references considered in the reexamination proceedings. Thereafter, the case was transferred from the District of Utah to the United States District Court for the District of Delaware (�District of Delaware�). On July 22, 2021, in another case against a different defendant, the District of Utah invalidated multiple claims of the �302, �022, and �615 Patents under 35 USC �101, including claims asserted against the Company. On December 27, 2021, the District of Delaware stayed the case pending the Federal Circuit's resolution of Bard's appeal from the Utah Decision. On February 17, 2023, the Federal Circuit Reversed-in-Part, Vacated-in-Part, and Remanded the Utah
20

Table of Contents
Decision. The other defendant subsequently filed a Petition for Rehearing with the Federal Circuit on March 20, 2023, and a mandate has not yet issued. The District of Delaware lifted the stay on February 28, 2023 and held a status conference on March 23, 2023. A scheduling order has not yet been entered, but a jury trial is currently scheduled for April 29, 2024. The Company has not recorded an expense related to the outcome of this litigation because it is not yet possible to determine if a potential loss is probable nor reasonably estimable.
   
     On March 10, 2015, Bard and Bard Peripheral Vascular filed suit in the District of Delaware claiming certain of the Company's implantable port products infringe on�three�U.S. patents held by Bard (US Patent Nos. 8,475,417, 8,545,460, 8,805,478). The case proceeded through trial which began on March 4, 2019. At the close of Bard�s case, the Court granted the Company's oral motion for judgment as a matter of law as well as its motions for summary judgment on the grounds that the asserted patents are invalid, ineligible, not infringed and not willfully infringed. On May 10, 2019, the Company filed a motion for attorney fees and non-taxable expenses under 35 USC Sec. 285. Bard appealed the judgment to the Federal Circuit and on November 10, 2020, the Federal Circuit reversed the judgment in part with respect to Section 101 (subject matter eligibility), and vacated and remanded the trial court�s invalidity and non-infringement judgments. Following remand from the Federal Circuit, a jury trial commenced in the District of Delaware beginning November 14, 2022. On November 22, 2022, a jury entered a verdict finding that certain of the Company�s implantable port products infringe certain claims of U.S. patents held by Bard. The issue of damages was bifurcated by the Court during trial, was not determined by the jury and will be subject to a separate proceeding. The Company strongly disagrees with the claims and the verdict. The issues presented to the jury do not comprise all of the issues to be determined in the case. Equitable issues remain to be decided by the judge, and damages remain to be decided by a jury. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses and positions with respect to the matters remaining to be decided and the jury decision, and intends to vigorously pursue all available remedies and defenses, including post-trial motions and appeals. The parties have filed post-trial briefs, and the Court heard argument on March 13, 2023. A decision is forthcoming. The Company maintains its belief that Bard�s claims are without merit. The Company has not recorded an expense related to the outcome of this litigation because it is not yet possible to determine if a potential loss is probable nor reasonably estimable.
   
     On March 8, 2021, Bard filed suit in the District of Delaware asserting certain of the Company�s port products (including certain related infusion sets) infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 8,025,639, 9,603,992 and 9,603,993. On December 27, 2021, the District of Delaware stayed the case pending the Federal Circuit's resolution of Bard's appeal of the Utah decision invalidating multiple claims of the �302, �022, and �615 patents under 35 USC �101. Following the Federal Circuit�s decision on appeal, the District of Delaware lifted the stay on February 28, 2023, and held a scheduling conference on March 23, 2023. A scheduling order has not yet been entered, but a jury trial is currently scheduled for June 9, 2025. The Company maintains its belief that Bard's claims are without merit. The Company has not recorded an expense related to the outcome of this litigation because it is not yet possible to determine if a potential loss is probable nor reasonably estimable.
   
AngioDynamics, Inc. v. C.R. Bard, Inc.

     On May 30, 2017, the Company commenced an action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York entitled AngioDynamics, Inc. v. C.R. Bard, Inc. and Bard Access Systems, Inc. (�Bard�). In this action, the Company alleged that Bard had illegally tied the sales of its tip location systems to the sales of its PICCs in violation of federal antitrust laws and this practice had an anti-competitive effect in the US market for PICCs. The Company sought both monetary damages and injunctive relief. On October 6, 2022, a jury verdict was rendered finding Bard did not restrain competition in violation of federal antitrust laws.

Executive Overview
     AngioDynamics is a leading and transformative medical technology company focused on restoring healthy blood flow in the body's vascular system, expanding cancer treatment options and improving quality of life for patients. We design, manufacture and sell a wide range of medical, surgical and diagnostic devices used by professional healthcare providers for vascular access, for the treatment of peripheral vascular disease and for use in oncology and surgical settings. Our devices are generally used in minimally invasive, image-guided procedures. Many of our products are intended to be used once and then discarded, or they may be temporarily implanted for short- or long-term use.
24

Table of Contents
     Our business operations cross a variety of markets. Our financial performance is impacted by changing market dynamics, which have included an emergence of value-based purchasing by healthcare providers, consolidation of healthcare providers, the increased role of the consumer in health care decision-making and an aging population, among others. In addition, our growth is impacted by changes within our sector, such as the merging of competitors to gain scale and influence; changes in the regulatory environment for medical devices; and fluctuations in the global economy.
     Our sales and profitability growth also depends, in part, on the introduction of new and innovative products, together with ongoing enhancements to our existing products. Expansions of our product offerings are created through internal and external product development, technology licensing and strategic alliances. We recognize the importance of, and intend to continue to make investments in research and development activities and selective business development opportunities to provide growth opportunities.
     We sell our products in the United States primarily through a direct sales force, and outside the U.S. through a combination of direct sales and distributor relationships. Our end users include interventional radiologists, interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons, urologists, interventional and surgical oncologists and critical care nurses. We expect our businesses to grow in both sales and profitability by expanding geographically, penetrating new markets, introducing new products and increasing our presence internationally.
     The COVID-19 global pandemic has impacted our business and may continue to pose future risks with the emergence of new variants. Even with the public health actions that have been taken to reduce the spread of the virus, the market continues to experience disruptions with respect to consumer demand, hospital operating procedures and workflow, trends that may continue. The Company's ability to manufacture products, the reliability of our supply chain, labor shortages, backlog and inflation (including the cost and availability of raw materials, direct labor and shipping) have impacted our business, trends that may continue. Accordingly, management continues to evaluate the Company�s liquidity position, communicate with and monitor the actions of our customers and suppliers, and review our near-term financial performance.
     On August 30, 2022, the Company repaid all amounts outstanding under its then existing credit agreement and entered into a new Credit Agreement. The new Credit Agreement provides for a $75.0�million Revolving Facility and a $30.0�million Delayed Draw Term Loan. As of February�28, 2023, $25.0 million was drawn on the Revolving Facility and $25.0 million was drawn on the Delayed Draw Term Loan. See Note 7 "Long-Term Debt" set forth in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements.
    Commencing with the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, the Company began to manage its operations through two segments, Med Tech and Med Device to align with the transformation from a company with a broad portfolio of largely undifferentiated products to a more focused medical technology company.
     In evaluating the operating performance of our business, management focuses on company-wide and segment revenue and gross margin and company-wide operating income, earnings per share and cash flow from operations. A summary of these key financial metrics for the three and nine months ended February�28, 2023 compared to the three and nine months ended February�28, 2022 are as follows:
     Three months ended February�28, 2023:
�Revenue increased by 9.1% to $80.7 million.
�Med Tech growth of 16.6% and Med Device growth of 6.4%.
�Gross profit decreased 200 bps to 50.2%.
�Med Tech gross profit decreased 150 bps to 64.6% and Med Device gross profit decreased 260 bps to 44.5%.
�Net loss increased by $4.5 million to $9.5 million.
�Loss per share increased by $0.11 to a loss of $0.24.
Nine months ended February�28, 2023:
�Revenue increased by 8.1% to $247.7 million.

�The change in other expense of $0.3 million and $1.1 million for�the three and nine months ended February�28, 2023, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, is primarily due to increased interest expense of $0.6 million and $1.3 million, respectively and unrealized foreign currency fluctuations of $0.3 million and $0.2 million, respectively.

Our effective tax rate including discrete items for the nine months ended February�28, 2023 and 2022 was 4.9% and 12.7%, respectively. In fiscal year 2023, the Company�s effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to the impact of the valuation allowance, foreign taxes, and other non-deductible permanent items (such as non-deductible meals and entertainment, Section 162(m) excess compensation and non-deductible share-based compensation).
Liquidity and Capital Resources
     We regularly review our liquidity and anticipated capital requirements in light of the significant uncertainty created by the COVID-19 global pandemic. We believe that our current cash on hand and availability under our Credit Agreement provides sufficient liquidity to meet our anticipated needs for capital for at least the next 12 months. We are closely monitoring receivables and payables.
     Our cash and cash equivalents totaled $30.1 million as of February�28, 2023, compared with $28.8 million as of May�31, 2022. As of February�28, 2023 and May�31, 2022, total debt outstanding related to the Credit Agreement was $50.0 million ($25.0 million on the Revolving Facility and $25.0 million on the Delayed Draw Term Loan) and $25.0 million, respectively. The fair value of contingent consideration liability as of February�28, 2023 and May�31, 2022, was $19.1 million and $16.9 million, respectively.

Cash used in operating activities
Nine months ended February�28, 2023 and 2022:
�Net loss of $31.0 million and $20.3 million, respectively, plus the non-cash items, primarily driven by depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation, along with the changes in working capital below, contributed to cash used in operations of $15.9 million and $15.8 million, respectively, for these periods.
�For the period ended February�28, 2023, working capital was unfavorably impacted by decreased accounts payable, accrued liabilities and other liabilities of $7.1 million, along with increased inventory and prepaid expenses of�$12.3 million and $0.4 million, respectively, partially offset by decreased accounts receivable of�$0.8 million.
�For the period ended February�28, 2022, working capital was unfavorably impacted by decreased accounts payable, accrued liabilities and other liabilities of $11.8 million, along with increased receivables and prepaid expenses of $6.4 million and $7.1 million, respectively.

Cash provided by financing activities
Nine months ended February�28, 2023 and 2022:
�$70.0 million in proceeds on long-term debt less the repayment of $45.0 million associated with the new Credit Agreement in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. The $25.0 million draw on the Delayed Draw Term Loan associated with the new Credit Agreement is to fund the historical and planned fiscal year 2023 purchases of Auryon placement and evaluation units. See Note 7 "Long-Term Debt" set forth in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements;
�$0.8 million of deferred financing costs associated with the new Credit Agreement;
�$5.0 million draw on the Revolving Facility in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 for the QX Medical asset acquisition; and
�$1.2 million and $2.4 million, respectively, of proceeds from stock option and ESPP activity.
     On August 30, 2022, the Company repaid all amounts outstanding under its then existing credit agreement and entered into a new Credit Agreement. The new Credit Agreement provides for a $75.0�million Revolving Facility and a $30.0�million Delayed Draw Term Loan, and also includes an uncommitted expansion feature that allows the Company to increase the total revolving commitments and/or add new tranches of term loans in an aggregate amount not to exceed $75.0 million.� The Credit Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants, and acceleration, indemnity and events of default provisions, including, among other things, two financial covenants. One financial covenant requires us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.25 to 1.00. The other financial covenant requires us to maintain a total leverage ratio of not greater than 3.00 to 1.00. The total leverage ratio is based upon our trailing twelve months total adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The amount that we can borrow under our Credit Agreement is directly based on our leverage ratio. The interest rate at February�28, 2023 applicable to each was 6.15%. The Company was in compliance with the Credit Agreement covenants as of February�28, 2023.
     In the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 and in connection with the new Credit Agreement, the Company drew $25.0 million on the Revolving Facility. The Company also drew $25.0 million on the Delayed Draw Term Loan to fund the historical and planned fiscal year 2023 purchases of Auryon placement and evaluation units for total long-term debt outstanding of $50.0 million. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, the Company made a $5.0 million draw on the Revolving Facility in conjunction with the QX Medical asset acquisition. We believe that our current cash balance, together with cash generated from operations and access to our Revolving Facility, will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our anticipated needs for capital for at least the next 12 months. If we seek to make acquisitions of other businesses or technologies in the future for cash, we may require external financing.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
     We are exposed to market risk from changes in currency exchange rates, as well as interest rate fluctuations on our Credit Agreement and investments that could impact our results of operations and financial position.
     We transact sales in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, particularly the Euro, British Pound and Canadian Dollar. For the nine months ended February�28, 2023, approximately 5% of our sales were denominated in foreign currencies. We do not have expenses denominated in foreign currencies at the level of our sales and as a result, our profitability is exposed to currency fluctuations. When the U.S. Dollar strengthens, our sales and gross profit will be negatively impacted. In addition, we have assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies which are remeasured at each reporting period, with the offset to changes presented as a component of Other (Expenses) Income. Significant non-functional balances include accounts receivable due from a sub-section of our international customers.
Interest Rate Risk
     The Credit Agreement provides for a $75.0�million Revolving Facility and a $30.0�million Delayed Draw Term Loan. Interest on the Revolving Facility and Delayed Draw Term Loan will be based, at the Company's option, on a rate equal to (i) the SOFR plus 0.10% (subject to a floor of 0%), or (ii) if the Company elects to treat a borrowing as an ABR Borrowing, an alternate base rate based on SOFR, plus, in each case an applicable margin of 1.25%, 1.50% or 1.75%, depending on the leverage ratio. If any amount is not paid when due, the interest rate may be increased by 2.0%. As of February�28, 2023, there was $25.0�million outstanding on the Delayed Draw Term Loan and $25.0�million outstanding on the Revolving Facility and the interest rate at February�28, 2023 was 6.15%.
Concentration of Credit Risk
     Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk, consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, our Credit Facility and trade accounts receivable.
     The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents at various institutions and performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standings of these financial institutions to ensure their credit worthiness. In addition, the Credit Agreement is structured across three above investment grade banks. The Company has the ability to draw amongst the three banks which limits the concentration of credit risk of one institution.
     Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of customers that purchase products from the Company. No single customer represents more than 10% of total sales. The Company monitors the creditworthiness of its customers. As the Company�s standard payment terms are 30 to 90 days from invoicing, the Company does not provide any significant financing to its customers. Although the Company does not currently foresee a significant credit risk associated with the outstanding accounts receivable, repayment is dependent upon the financial stability of our customers.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures
     As of the end of the period covered by this report, our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
     There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal quarter ended February�28, 2023 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
